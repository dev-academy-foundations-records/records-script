# Final Reflections - Sprint Three

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I would say 50/50. Sometimes I feel like I can really understand somethings but then sometimes I really cant get how other things work.

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?

I would say most definately doing the Cafe challange and doing the code with Joseph.

### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?

LOOPS!!!!!

### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?

Some parts of JS I though it was really hard and that I would never been able to do what other people are doing.
I know it is just a process learning and maybe I am just at a stage of my life where things are being very hard for a couple of month.
I have not given up because if other people can do it I will do it too, I cannot give up on something that I want so bad just because is difficult. That would not be me.
