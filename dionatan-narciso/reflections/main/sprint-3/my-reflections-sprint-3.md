# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

No

### How did you find the overall experience?

Relaxing but also quiet difficult, I never medidated before and my mind is always going 100km.

### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness?

My commitment is to take about 15 min a day during lunchbreak. I think that if I can relax for this period in the middle of the day it will be helpfull for my learning jearny.

# Listening and Looping

### What was it like to be fully listened to?

I do therapy every week and the feeling of someone fully listening you is really great.

### What was it like to fully listen?

I think listning to someone without interuption is a very powerful tool to really embrace and understand someone else's feelings.

# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?

I am a more of a visual learner, I think it's easier to understand how it works seen someone else do it but yet loops did not get into my head.

### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?

No I did not keep it in time. I feel like loops took so much more of my time then the other exercises and I could not complete on my own.

# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?

It was really great, seen Joseph working through it is very inspiring and also helped me to understand a little bit more of what each thing do and why.

### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?

I believe how everything works and connect like using the DOM for ex. is amazing all the things you can do with JS. Now I understend why most large websites dont have all their contexts on HTML.
