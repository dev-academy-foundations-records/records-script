# My Reflections - Sprint One

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?

It's fun, I guess once you memorize most of the commands is like playing a game wihout looking at the keyboard to know what every skill will do.

### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

No, I would ask for help sooner.

### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1. cd - to navigate
2. mkdir - to create a new directory
3. touch - to create a new folder
4. ls - to know what is in the folder
5. pwd - to know where is the directory located

### Did you learn anything unexpected?

Yes, how to open a doc. or text into VScode from the terminal. Also, how to connect the terminal with the internet is pretty cool.

# Version Control with Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is a program that allow programers to work on the same file wihout over writing each other codes and GitHub is used to store online and share this files from each other's computers.

### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?

It's like working on a file using a cloud like dropbox, but in a much more efficient way.

### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?

Yes

### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

Not all the times, I feel like there are subjects where as I can understand quiet easily and subjects that take me longer to understand or create an opinion about it.

# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a Git workflow?

Is is program where people can work on the same project simultaneously. It stores all the commands and changes that have been done to the a project for ex, allowing people to work on the same project from different places.

### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

I've noticed that you can do much more with the terminal using git then i imagined it, is amazing what only a few commands can do.
When I was confused i mostly looked into youtube and google for help.

### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?

Yes, read EVERYTHING! One unnoticed command might get you stuck in the future.

# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?

Stage is like when you're making a pizza, you know what you adding on it and if anything goes wrong you can just get it out. Commit is adding the pizza to the oven, is like when you decide to go ahead with it =).

# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?

Is the folder that contains all the original code.

### Why create a Branch?

So you or someone else can add and experiment new commands or debugs without changing the main file.

### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?

Not difficult, just complex and sometimes is a lot to process.

# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?

When you are working with a third party for ex but you dont want them to have access to the raw code.

### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

Yes, when I was trying to send all my code back to GitHub I was having some difficulties, but sudendly I looked into my notes and realised what I was doing was wrong, from that moment it just felt
so easy to conect my PC with HitHub.

# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?

I have not, very the opposite, this is very exciting!

### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

I kinda had an idea of how websites were made, this is what I imagined it would look like at first. I also did a online course with Codecademy but all the process of creating a website is based on their online platform and knowing how to really create something from scratch feels really good.

# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?

So far it has been google research, some youtube videos and facilitators when I cannot find a solution.

# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?

It feels quiet wierd, I dont usually stop to think about myself and what my values are on the daily basis. It is in fact interisting to see how your ideas and values change with time but there
are also the values that come from your family which will hardly change.

### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?

I've been very down on myself lately and I dont think my ego present right now, guess I am on a very self conscious part of my life.
