# Final Reflections - Sprint One

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?

I believe that reading aditional documents have helped me to understand a bit more of what the challange was.
The biggest problem for me was to understand what exactly I had to do.

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I guess I am confident about 80%. I really understood what everything does but there is always a dought =X.

### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?

Working with the terminal was the most fun part for me.

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

None.

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

Yes, at some parts I thought I wouldn't be able to understand and I felt so dumb but I tried hard and seek for help, and that made me believe I can do anything.
