# Final Reflections - Sprint Four

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I feel ok, I had to get a lot of help on sprint-4 and I feel very behind from where I should be.

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?

Variables

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?

Manipulating objects

### How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?

Breaks

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say?

Be kind to yourself, it's taking time but you will get it.
