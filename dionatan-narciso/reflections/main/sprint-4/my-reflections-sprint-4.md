# My Reflections - Sprint Four

# Code Readability

### What makes code more readable for you?

When I can clearly understand everything that is going on.

### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?

Tabs

### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?

Very clean and tidy, I am a very organised person.

# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    let expected = 7
    let actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```

### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`:

function sum(x, y) {
if (x != y) {
console.log("It's broken..")
}
else
{
console.log("It works!")
}
}

### Do you think you would prefer using Test Driven Development? Why?

Yes, I think is good to test all developments of coding all the time.

# Kata

### How did you find using repl.it in practice? Confusing? Useful?

A bit confusing at times

### Was it helpful to look at the tests while coding the kata?

Yes, very helpful!

### What problem solving techniques did you implement in your coding flow?

The ones I did the most was error messages, googling and asking Joseph for help.

### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?

Looping is still very hard and confusing for me, I still have not anderstood what every piece of code does.

### Did you want to change and refactor your code once you were finished?

Not change but I did came back to read everything and try to understand how it all works.
