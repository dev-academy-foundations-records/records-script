# My Reflections - Sprint Two

# Your Blog

### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?

Created a website with the structure (html) and the style (css) sheets to a future blog.

### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?

Quiet difficult at times as I get distracted once I start a research.

# Learn HTML and CSS

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?

I guess understanding all the ways of doing the same thing and trying to find e easiest one. By doing some research.

### What are of you proud of from this challenge?

Pround of having the basic knowledge of how to creat and design a website.

# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?

I believe that my learning style is much more focused when I am watching someone doing the code and that reading is probably my least fastest way of learning as I can find it confusing and overwelming.
My strengths are remembering things that I saw quiet easily, even if I dont remember the code I will remember that I have already seen it and where I saw it.
My limitations are mostly on really understand when it comes to more tecnical code or something that I havent read or saw.

### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?

I believe the console part of DevTools is where I got stuck the most, specially with the console.log which is something I have not seen yet.

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

I only have learning tabs open right now. I try to not open anything not related to learning when I am styduing as I can easily get distracted and spend hours doing something else.

### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.

I did played out changing words and images positions on the page.

# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.

Well... CSS and HTML are two different languages that rely on each other. Is funny to see how things change when you start adding some style on CSS but then what would be of this style without the base?
I enjoy working on both of them even tho sometimes things seems to be so complicated (which they are not).

### Any moments of surprise or joy?

Styling my blog with a dropdown menu was very nice, even tho it is still a bit messy.

### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?

I would say HTML is like a coral and CSS is the fish, they rely on each other and together they look nice
