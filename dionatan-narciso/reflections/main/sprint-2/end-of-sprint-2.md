# Final Reflections - Sprint Two

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?

I got myself stuck at some parts of the sprint so I would say 3/5

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?

HTML AND CSS

### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?

JavaScript Primer

### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?

I think I am being quiet hard on myself this sprint, there are things I could not completely understand and I feel dumb sometimes. I tried to have breaks but I dont usually relax till problems are solved.

### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?

Do you have time? lol
