<h2>### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?</h2>

so this week i got a little bit distracted I went off on my own a little bit and tried to create a chess game in js, Ill probably add it to the website.
I feel confident working with the dom, I think i understand the structure of it and how its a useful way of getting your js and your html to interact with each other, I 
have only interacted with a small amount of the functions for it, motly the "documnet.getelementbyid()" and "appendchild()". I didnt do the java script cafe lesson, even thought that was the lesson that was supposed to pull the sprint together. I did do somthing simillar im not really to sure what i missed out on, but In my little chess i learned quite a bit about using the dom and using it to interact with java script.

idk man how much does writing this shit out even help, there was somthing about just writing  with a stream of conciouness , is that what we where suposed to do for the reflections??? maybe, but its going to read like some cracked out bullshit, idk.I guess I just need to mellow out a bit, like know things will be ok and they will , panic and things will be bad. Why am i like this, why am i completley calm when things are falling apart but when things are fine im losing my mind and worrying about what could go wrong. Your mindset colours your reality, If you think everything will be ok, things will be good . If you have doubt you are slowing yourself down.so yea remember that things will be better if you are mellow and calm.

<h2>### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?</h2>
happy? what made me happy? working in JS made me happy when i can do clean and elegant solutions , I think its satisfying, but probably not happy. All this stuff is pretty fun so idk, I like updating my little website, I like that, I think thats what ive enjoyed the most of all this, im pretty happy with my website tbh I think that it is pretty disgustingly cute.

<h2>### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?</h2>
angry??? what ? no??
<br>
<br>

<h2>### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?</h2>
during a lot of the writing it got me thinking stuff like what am i even doing, like the majority of this sprint for me has just been writing stuff, like no acutal coding.
I started on the neural plasticity and growth mindset reasearch and it got me thinking about the only way to improve at somthing is by doing it and pushing yourself at it.
and I feel like I could be doing so much more if i applied myself to study or building somthing.
