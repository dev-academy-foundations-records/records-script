<h1># Final Reflections - Sprint One </h1>

So I still need to push my reflections repo and need to github and fill in the feedback , if the ffed back is too much of  a mish I might just pass on it.
but at least the content so far has been pretty good I think.

<br>
<br>

Ive not really used gitbash that much, and am only really familiar with using cmd prompt. So its been nice learning linux or ubuntu I'm still not really sure what its called, linux terminal??
<br>
<br>
I know that I wasted a good amount of time trying to get with the github token, that was pretty frustrating.
<br>
<br>
I feel pretty confident with gitbash and using the terminal, still kind of fuzzy on the whole pull request thing and branches.
<br>
<br>
so when I do "git pull" that will find that repositry and download the content to where I am working in? 
And is that the same as a pull request im not really sure, It feels kind of pointless "reflecting" on this since I can easily just google the answer, but hey got to reflect on somthing will probably just read up on it in a second.
<br>
<br>
so there is a commit history where you can restore a previous version with "git reset --hard HEAD" or soft and you have a little log of whatever cute little commits that you made and then you can restore a previous branch if you have made a mistake.
<br>
<br>
you can also make a branch which is like a seperate copy of the reposity and the branch has a log and you can branch the branches or whatever, but if you want to make a change to main? master? origin? im not really sure what the differnce between these is like not really sure what the differnce between main branch and master branch is.  but each branch will have its own commit log and you can undo the commits in each branch, also im not really sure I understand the diffence between a fork and a branch either, is a fork supposed to be more of a philisophical disagrement about the project and the fork will be maintained by a different group of people to serve a different purpose to the origional, but a branch is more like wanting to add features but not mess up the main branch, or have youre work overwritten by someone else. and after the branch you do a pull request which is what?? nothing its just a request, I guess you do a pull request on the branch that you have pushed no?? its just that pull kind of makes me think of pull down. Im not really sure what "pull" refers to. so when you pull with git bash it will take the repo at the url you have and make the repo the one pulled from the url??
and pull pull request is to make the main branch the branch that gets pulled??/>>?>? so its like when you do a pull request on a branch you are saying "hey pick me, make me the main branch"
<br>
<br>
but yea, this is pretty half baked
<br>
<br>
I do think that I should probably spend some more time learning git becuase it feel like it will be a super usefull tool, but part of me kind of feels like meh, we can cross that bridge when we come to it, the best way to learn it would probably be to start a project and use it for version control, like yea you probably would learn a bunch more features if you sat down with the goal of "learning git", but I find for me that learning is much more effective when it is functional. There might be a few sickos out there that read the entire documentation but im pretty sure that most people just take what they need.
<br>
<br>
Im not really sure If this will be read or not,But I hope that this is coherant , but also yea, this probably sucks to read.
<br>

<h1>### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?</h1>

I had problems with generating a token. 
I created a token I didnt give it any permisions.
I couldnt git push and upload push it to git hub and would get an authentication error .
I wasted a few hours trying to fix my problem, when I needed to regenerate my token.
<br>
<br>
I should probably have asked for help, but I hate the awkwardness of trying to explain a problem that I dont have any of the right things for
<br>
<br>
I guess I probably could have just said  
"hey, Im having some trouble pushing my repo to github. I'm pretty sure all my details are correct but its giving me an authentication error."
<br>
<br>
but idk, ill probably run in to more issues like this in the future.





<h1>### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?</h1>

enough, I probably need to spend another 15 mins on branching and understanding pull.





<h1>### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?</h1>
I liked most parts, idk working in terminal was kind of fun, like opening a directory with explorer.exe . or code . hehe. It 



<h1>### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?</h1>

watching youtube videos with 2k views terrible quality to try fix some of my issues, Most of them are just straight up bad bro, like isnt tiktok or youtube shorts like the perfect format for a tutorial, Im not saying that long and unedited tutorials are bad, but if you are doing a tutorial on how to fix somthing most people will probably go through a couple before they find a fix that works, im definatley going to be more frusrated with youre video if you drag it out and mumble if Ive already watched 4 previous videos that didnt work, anyway probably shouldnt cry about it. 
<br>
<br>
I should probably just accept that whatever problem im dealing with it will prbably take at least twice as long to fix as I expect and I should just be willing to go onto forums like stackoverflow for answers and do my best to read and understand, becuase often the quality of information is better than video tutorials and I find that is where I often expand my knowledgezzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz but aasaasasas

<br>
<br>
yea but just be patient probably. Instead of thinking why do things happen to me when I encounter a problem accept that I am the problem and that or somthing like that, often I will go to the obscure solutions instead of the simple ones first idk I think that I just need a bit more humility in general when dealing with problems. whwhwh. because like when I encounter a problem at somthing outside the process rather than part of the process or some shit like that, I think that zen and the art of motor cycle maintaince kind of hits the nail on the head where when you have a problem with technology or just a problem in general, you have to accept that the problem is part of the process i guess idk, you cant really have the mentality that the problem is just a random factor outside your control and that you just happen to be unlucky for encountering it, idk be all zen about it or whatever, you kind of have to be present with the problem rather than skiming for solutions quickly and getting frustrated when the thing you spent all of 30 seconds searching fror and reading dosent work..... idk maaaaaaaaannn. 
<br>
<br>
just be present with stuff i guess, whatever that means. idk. 
<br>
<br>
I guess yea its like stop view things as getting in your way, excpect a certain amount of things to go wrong things will always get in your way in life that is just the nature of things instead of saying why are you in my way, all you can really say is I was excpecting you sooner and try keep your peace of mind.



<h1>### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
</h1>
self citical voice??? maybe, I was feeling pretty down this week so I guess ive been pretty self critical but that for other reasons. bubbububbu. I guess I had lots of thoughts like I could have done this more effeciently or I could have done this faster, or I could have done a more thorough job at learning the content, but at the end of the day its not a sprint, well a litle bit I guess. Im going to try and do what I can, I know I could be more effecient in certain areas and I know I could do like time keeping or whatever like we where recomended too, but I think that I know myself enough that when I do my best work it is usualy when im just playing with things and not really trying to be super effecient klnlknnlknkknllnkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkknklnlklknnklnklnnnknklnklnnkknnklnklnklnknlnknklnklnklnklnklknl

anyway gnight Im going to sleep now its way to late.
