              I feel good with html, dont really understnad what the differences between the labels are, for example you can put a link in a div and you can put a link in a but I dont understand what the difference between the two is. I have a pretty clear idea of how the blocks work and how you can have elemnets inside of other elements, there is still a lot that I dont know, but I think Im begening to understand the structure of html a bit more and how things should be aranged and put together.

              CSS I dont really understand, there dosent really seem to be much order or structure to it, If I am trying to do somthing simple I can get it in a few tries, but anything more complicated just feels like trying to guess.  So far I seem to have done everything that Ive been trying to, even though css stll feels pretty confusing.
              
              
              
              <h1>### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?</h1>
              
              Im not really sure, I guess I new a bit of html and css to begin with, so doing this was a nice refresher, I think that My understanding of how html blocks work is a bit better and how you use css to manipulate the shapes and the layouts.
              
              
              
              <h1> ### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?</h1>
              using css, its like being in a chaotic vortex where nothing makes sense.
              Why is this taking so long, 
              
              
              
              <h1>### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?</h1>
              why is this taking so long, nothing is coming together.
              
              
              
              <h1>### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?</h1>
              Use wordpress. dont waste your time learning html and css hahaha.
