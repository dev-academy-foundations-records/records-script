              <h1>The difference between display inline vs inline-block</h1>
              <div>

              Here is our html code, we want the text to display all on one line. <br> <br> We have given the divs a border so we can better
               visualize whats happening.
              <br>
              <br>

              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
               This is what it looks like in browser.
              
              <br>
              <br>
              <img src="../images/block.png" alt="">
              <br>
              <br>
              We add a little bit of padding, because padding is nice. Also will help us see the difference between, inline and inline-block.
              <br>
              <br>
              <img src="../images/blockpadding.png" alt="">
              <br>
              <br>
              we add inline to our div elements with css
              <br>
              <br>
              <img src="../images/inlinecode.png" alt="">
              <br>
              <br>
              so this is what it looks like when we use inline block, all the div elements are placed on the same line. Notice how the padding width is 
              respected but not the height. you cannot change the height or the width of a div if you use inline.

              <br>
              <br>
              <img src="../images/inline.png" alt="">
              <br>
              <br>
              now we change "inline" to be "inline-block".
              <br>
              <br>
              <img src="../images/inlineblockcode.png" alt="">
              <br>
              <br>
              Now the padding height is respected as well, now there is no overlap of the block.
              if you use inline-block you can change the width and the height of the element.

              <br>
              <br>
              <img src="../images/inlineblock.png" alt="">
              <br>
              <br>

              so to summarise, inline block is good for fitting different elements into the same line where yo
              u dont want to use things like padding or margin or change the width or height,

              <br>
              <br>
              adding a link onto a paragraph would be an example of somthing that you would use inline for. 
              If you are aranging elements where sizing and spacing is somthing the is important you should use inline-block instead.
