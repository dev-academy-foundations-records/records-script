	<h3>What is Javascript, HTML and CSS:</h3>
  so a website has javascript, html and css. Javascript is the mind, html is the body and css is the soul.

  <h3>HTML:</h3>
  Hypertext Markup Language or HTML is a document that is design to be displayed inside of your web browser, vanilla html is very limited
  and without CSS or Javascript it may as well be a printed document.
  
  <h3>CSS:</h3>
  Cascading Style Sheet or css can be used to change the presentation of a HTML document. CSS can change the layout, colour, size of the html elements,font,fontsize
  but yea, css is almost as import as html.
  
  <h3>JavaScript:</h3>
  javascript is a programing language, it is the most common language used for websites.
  what else is there to say you can edit html and css elements with it, and add event listeners.
  
  
  
  
  
  and javascript controls the logic and you can manipulate the html elemetns with it.
  
    what is control flow and loops:
  control flow is kind of like a flowing river and parts of the river can be blocked or unblocked these would be our "if statments", or parts of the river where the water kind of flows around in a circle and these would be our for loops i guess. But yea, the control flow is basicaly the path that the program takes and which lines of code get run.
  
  
  <h3>what is a loop?</h3>
  A loop is just a section of code that repeats itself and each time it runs through the section of code it checks whether or not the condition for the loop to break has been met or not.

  <h3>what is a DOM:</h3>  
  document object model. The document is like a copy of all your html and the changes that you make to the document object will also be made to your html.
  to access a element from the document object you would use a function like "document.getelementbyid()" or if you wanted to add an element you would use the Node.appendChild() function.
