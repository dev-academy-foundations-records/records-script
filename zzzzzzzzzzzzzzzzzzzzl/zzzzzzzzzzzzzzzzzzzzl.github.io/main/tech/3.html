              <h1>code readability.</h1>

              so a lot of these concepts are kind of going over my head for code readabilty, but I like modularizing;one function per task, This is somthing that i try to implement I think that using this
              makes your code so much easier to read and follow, especially if you are coming back to it after some time, working in this way makes thing feel organized and less cluterd I think that this 
              is probably one of the most important things.

              indentation, python is probably my most favorite launguage it just feels nice to work in I get that you know, I get that its probably not the fsatest but dude,using indentation instead of 
              backets just feels nice, it keeps your code organized by default, like im sure the more time I spend working other languages I will probably be more mindfull of using indentation 
              but like just from a design standpoint I think its so much better, if you are going to use indentation for {} anyway then why do you need the brackets like idk it just feels uneccercary,
              does it compile faster or somthing, like by far the worst thing about javascript for me is removing a { and feeling completely lost and not knowing where the other bracket is, like 
              this isnt even a programing problem this is just the IDE, {}; curly brackets are just a pain. but yea indentation is also super important to have nice and clean and readable code.

              <br>
              
              naming things is important if you start giving things names like megatron or array5 you are just going to cause a massive headache for whoever is the next person to look at your code, which is probably you.
              so yea best just be sensible with your naming like, really just take a little longer to think about what the thing you have created does, escpecially if it is a function or a class give it a nice name.
              
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself "><h1>dont repeat yourself</h1> </a>
              
              every piece of knowledge must have a sungle, unambiguos, authoritative representation within your system. I like this. You should probably think more clearly and carfully about what each segment of your code does or what your
              functions do. If you want to write somthing quickly I find that I usualy end up repeating myself; with small little things and the code becomes quite bloated, but when you think about what each segment is supposed to do 
              what purpose it serves and review it and remove rendundencies it feels a lot more clean and it all fits much better into your head.

              I dont coment very much, I need to comment more, but who knows what you should comment is it just very obvious what the thing does; so then commenting is just dumb, or is it a level of complexity where giving some more context
              to it will make the whole thing just easier on return, like I dont really know I dont really coment that much and when I see coments left by others they rarley help, so Im not entirely sure that I understand 
              the best use for coments is.
              
              <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/clean-coding-for-beginners/"><h1>clean code</h1></a>
              
              ok so yea pretty much just goes over the previous stuff except for a few things which are probably good to take into consideration , also we should message vinny.

              so yea, basicaly rewriting sections of code to make it still perform the same function but to just make it more readable.
