           <h1>1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h1>   
<br>
<br>
              I dont know chief.
              <br>
              <br>    
              I just dont know, a lot of the problems that I solve are self inflicted. Like I just dont knwo how useful a lot of the stuff I do is to other people.
              Like I am pretty good at fixing my computer when it stops working which happens quite a lot, like I feel like I am a person who faces a lot of technical problems,
              like stuff is never working quite how it should, somthing is not quite right with it, Am I just a reckless person is that it?? but its whatever because I feel like it has made pretty dynamic at diagnosing things.
              <br>
<br>
              I would say its just a matter of throwing shit at the wall until somthing sticks, I dont think that what I do is very systematic or methodical
              <br>
<br>
              what was the problem?
              <br>
              <br>          
              so my computer wouldnt turn on last week and it was kind of a bit of a probelm couldnt do any of the work for the sprint.
              <br>
<br>
              what problem-solving techniques did you use?
              <br>
              <br>          
              jsut googled some shit man, idk, idk what you are suposed to do without google, im probably just going to end up breaking stuff, like I would probably just use books relevenat,but I would have no idea how you would find those books without the internet, would I have to take it to a place, like idk man, the internet is pretty great.
              <br>
<br>
              but I had some spare parts which luckly worked which worked.
              <br>
              <br>          
              but idk you just sort of test each component and try to narrow down what the problem is being caused by.
              <br>
<br>
              how did you feel throughout the process?
              <br>
              <br>          
              just , incompetent, like  a monkey with a hammer, keep trying things and now it works again.
              <br>
<br>
              what did you learn?
              <br>
<br>
              idk man
              <br>
<br>
           <h1>  2. elegantly solved a problem.</h1> 
              <br>
<br>
              what was the problem?
              <br>

              pass
              <br>
              <br>

            <h1>  3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h1>
              <br>
              <br>          
            <h3> Pseudocode:</h3> 
              I like pseudocode when you have a complicated function you want to write spending some time to think about what its going to do the steps involved to make it work
              and what the redundancies you can remove are 
              <br>
<br>
              <h3>Trying something:</h3>
              What does this meaaaaaannn!!! do somthing, do anything. iidididi
              <br>
              <br>          
              
            <h3>Rubber ducky method:</h3>  
              yeaaaa. idk,, this is probably good. I like th. so whay is the rubber duck metod , its talking to a rubber duck and trying to explain your problem in a way that the rubber duck can understand, becuase like often when you have to verbalize somthing you can see what the gaps in your thinking are.
              <br>
<br>
              <h3>Reading error messages:</h3>
              yea somtimes helps, idk , usualy just check the line and throw in a console.log() to see if it is the value that i am expecting otherwise back up a bit and reread some of the previous code.
              <br>
<br>
              <h3>Console.logging</h3>
              I like this this is good, using console.log() to see what the values of your variables are or to see what the type of variable is, so its nice to use this 
              <br>
<br>
              <h3>Googling</h3>
              its the only way, maybe you have a cute little book on your desk about, somthing, but usualy if it is beginer level and not like something complex, you are probaly 
              best suited sticked with the inetenet, though my attention span is a little bit fucked because of google now, I cant read anymore because of google, now when i read i very quickly skim for key words, dude there are so many of these tech bros with their little blogs or youtube videos where they just insert themselves into them, its like, I dont mind a 1-2 hour video, but if your making a quick tutorial, the title is enough context for what it is about, speed run that shit son, lkike dont waste time with your "my name is jake and today we are going to be look at how the split() function works in javascript, que 30 second intro*, ok guys today we are looking at ___ in __ it would really mean a lot if you like and subscribe, ok now. without anything else lets get right into the tutorial", its like bro youve just waster 2 mins of my life and im already probably not in a great mood if my shits not working and i need to find some tuturoial to fix it.
              <br>
<br>
               also these fucks with their tech blogs, like I have so much love for whenever you come across a tutorial on a website and it is entirely done in html, that shit is pure and close to the source, the information is always quialty to the point, and it feel like it was made with love and kindness, but you go to these tech articales, and it is just filled with bullshit. where the article is probably 3 paragraphs long but only like 4 scentences refer to the technical thing and the rest of it is just fluff and you have the little ___ was the author of this article and there are like 15 adds on it and after you scroll the length of the page down it asks you to make an account, like i just feel dirty. I dont know why , it feels like they are all smiles , like they are trying to present themelves as profesional, kind of feels like imagine if some profesional well spoken well groomed guy in a suit comes up to you, asks you how your day is going and then imediatley asks you if he can borrow 5$. like you dont need to spend much time on these websites to understand what the motive of it is, like 
               <br>
               <br>
               here is a question, what is the soul of a thing. lets say every thing has a soul, every person, every being, every object, every shape , every concept. Not like in a super spiritual sense but more like. what is a things reason for being, what is the purpose of a thing. do you have a good and noble purpose ?? one where you educate and uplife others??, do you have a parasitic purpose, do you exist to seek out financial gain, though all things need money and resources, that is understandable its also corrupting. a thing is so much more pure when its not wanting somthing from you when it is a giving force that wants nothing in return, this may sound preachy, but I think that this is an important philosphy when it comes to the creation of things, is to bear in mind what is the purpose of the thing, why did i desing it the way I did, what motivated its creation, was it beceause ti was trendy and I thought that i could become more popular from following a trend, or I could make money, these are negative motivation for creation i feel and you can see it , its pallatable.

            <h3>Asking coaches for help:</h3>  
              <br>
<br>
              
              yea, i dont like this. I like critque I think that critique is pretty powerful, but having little trouble shooting questions makes me feel kind of bad, often if i am stuck on somthing its just easier to use google. If its irl and im not working on a computer i dont mind so much, but I think that a much better use would be to just show them work that I have done and ask them for feed back and how i could have done things differently.
              <br>
<br>
             <h3>Improving your process with reflection:</h3> 
              <br>
<br>
              whahjajh, I dont understand, what are you asking????????????????? what has this reflection made me think about. not so much, just how i havent really done a lot of probelm solving, i mean. I feel like i do, I would say that it is almost part of my identity and how i view myself is that I can solve most problems that I am faced with. iddididid
              what would i like to imprpove on with proiblem solving?? I think that i get stuck on things, i wish that i was beteter at rapidly prototyping and nbot being attatched to a specific idea, so many times, i just waste a lot of time on a individual idea, or wanting to do things from scratch by myself, which is stupid its jkust like pure ego man, there is no point to that, find someone else who is smarter more experinced and put more time into their solutions rather than my hack job dunning krueger ass.
