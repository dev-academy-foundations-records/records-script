so growth mindset vs fixed mindset.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset#Fixed_and_growth_mindsets

fixed mindset is noob thinking.
carol dweck says that people with a fixed mindset belive in static inteligence and a growth mindset is to stay in an area that is challanging to you.

to compare the two would be like viewing your job as the place that you make money or viewing your job as a place where you can improve and devolope skill.


she talks about the ways that the school system is broken, where it feels like the point of school is to take tests and that is a fixed mindset.
But I think that the most potent education that you could get would be in a mentorship Ideally in one where you are employed so there is incentive to do
a good job and not to fuck around.

the best way to learn shit though is to build shit, or if its a skill you cant build with , where you find somthing you cant do , and then try to do it and then when you can do it rinse and repeat. but yea like throwing tests in this process is fucking killer dude, liek why would you want to fuck up this beatifull sytem with tests, idk man. Also words are wind. just go do shit dont tlak about it.

In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?

ah yea, if you go into things with the mindset of "Im here to learn" you will learn stuff, if you go in with "im here to pass "



How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?

yea, know that the only reason im here to do anything is to learn, coming for any other reason is just a bad use of my time.
