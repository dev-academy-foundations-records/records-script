                <h1>  Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decison you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h1>  

Im good at doing the right thing when it is easy to, but there have been times that ive been tempted to do somthing that I know to be wrong, somthing that I know would be disloyal to a freind or do somthing that would 
comprimise somthing that Ive been working toward, or when Ive been an observer in a bad situation. When I think back to the times that Ive done wrong, or not acted when I should have, the things that have made it dificult to 
do the right thing have been:
<br>
<br>

-  lack of confidence; doing certain things, or saying or doing things that I dont agree with to impress people(though Ive mostly grown out of the latter.)
<br>
<br>
- laziness; not doing what is expected, or doing a sloppy job of somthing, causing extra work for someone else.
<br>
<br>
- selfishness; seeing an opurtunity where I can gain for myself at the expense of someone else, or not thinking of how my actions effect others.
<br>
<br>
- being manipulated; when I feel like I am being taken advantage of. 
<br>
<br>
other people will probably struggle with other things , but for me I think that it is important to bear these things in my mind when I have to make a difficult ethical decision and to try and recognize when 
my action is being effected by one of the above. When there is somthing in the way. Hopefully I dont come off too psycho when I write this , Its good to try to think about what might the reasons that make it hard for you to take
action. 
<br>
<br>
I dont think that I want to give a specific example of a situation, it feels a little bit too personal and it also feels bad giving a low stakes situation.
but basicly, the thing that I think is most important in a difficult situation  is acting with certainty, usualy you will have some time to think things through and come to an action that you should take, sometimes its imedietly 
obvious somtimes, but once you have decided on what it is that you are going to do act with certainty and if you are suited to deal with the problem then dont put resposoblity onto others.

<h1> Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity</h1>  
<br>
<br>
I grew up in west Auckland, I think west Auckland has quite a unique culture some of the people seem a bit mad, but I suppose everyone probably thinks that about the palce that they grew up.
when I think about my freinds and the people who have influenced me growing up , I've been around quite a few good people growing up and when I was younger I took opn a lot of there values,
but now as Im getting a bit older I'm realising that I don't agree with the things that they belived in and Im trying to discover my own values. I dont really have a clear idea of what they are just yet, becuase there are
a lot of things that I think that I belive in but somtimes, I will find that my actions condradict myself. 
<br>
<br>
at the moment the thing that I think Is most important for someone to have is self respect.
<br>
<br>
with self respect you can recognize your own value, you wont seek peoples aproval or interact with people who treat you poorly, you will have a clear Idea of the things that you would be willing to do and not willing to do.
you will be able to develope the ability to say no to people.You can recognize the value of your own time and focus, you can set boundries, idk the list goes on, maybe self respect isnt the cause of all of these but its
definatley a part of it, I think that having self respect is probably the corner stone in having a good life.
<br>
<br>
identity, I dont really have a strong identity, I can feel a bit ethereal somtimes, my sense of self is pretty weak, I think that identity is somthing that is important and it can give a stronger sense of purpose and meaning, 
but its somthing that I struggle with somtimes.

<h1> Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey</h1>  

I am open,creative and technical.
<br>
<br>
I am good at problem solving and trying new things and not clinging to much to one idea. I find it dificult to follow a ciriculum,
most of the programing that I have taught myself is when I have a project with a set of problems that I dont know how to solve, and
looking for solutions and how to apply them and looking for alternative solutions, which one will be the fastest to implement? will this be a usefull skill in the future, will it be somthing that Im likley to run into again?
am I getting too focused on one method that is to complicated and has a much easier solution? 
<br>
<br>
I am good at sitting with a problem. If there is somthing that I dont understand or somthing is not working when I think that it should be, I can be frustrated or confused, but there is some aspect to this which I enjoy and I can usualy 
persavere.
<br>
<br>
when I have a problem and am not told what the solution is and asked to find my own way of solving a problem I am much more invested in the problem




<h1> Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h1>  

I am not systematic or diligent.
<br>
<br>
I have pretty big organizational problems and is somthing that I need to improve at, since I began programing Ive come to understand the value of making things clear, orderd, readable, understandable and simple.
I struggle with this a lot and would like to see myself improve at this.
<br>
<br>
I am not diligent, I am not good at finishing things and fixing the small details of a thing, often I lose intrest once the interesting part of a project is done, or if it is a long task that requires a lot of repitition.





<h1> Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h1>  
<br>
<br>
I've worked on group assignments in the past where I have been the person that does everything, as well as the person who does nothing. There was an animation group project that I worked on in the past, 
I put a lot of effort in to it
I found it extremely demotivating when you could see that other people put very little effort into somthing that you dedicated yourself toward, I never did anything to address the problems I had with the situation, 
I dont think that you can change other peoples motivation, if people have other things to do or other focuses its hard, there isnt much you can say someone. When I was in highschool I was lousy group member and I did little, 
there was a huge sense of shame and guilt that I had through out the entire assignment and a feeling of confusion where since I was unenvolved I was not kept in the loop and didnt understand what needed to be done, 
where all of these 
things combined made it harder to contribute and the more time that passed the worse things got.
<br>
<br>
the only thing I can do in a situation like this is remember that the only thing that I have controll over is my own output.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
