### What makes code more readable for you?

good spacing , indentation, naming, good spacing



### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?
tab


### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?
my desk is usualy messy, it is a pile of things that i picked up lookded and thgat piles up over time until i decide that its to far and then time to clear it,
but I think that I put effort into making my code neat, I think that organization is like 50% of programing if yuou can arange and organize things you are more effectint it fits into your head better.



# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    let expected = 7
    let actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
function sum(a,b){return a+b}
```
### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`: 
```

```

### Do you think you would prefer using Test Driven Development? Why?
