# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?

I feel good with html, dont really understnad what the differences between the labels are, for example you can put a link in a div and you can put a link in a but I dont understand what the difference between the two is. I have a pretty clear idea of how the blocks work and how you can have elemnets inside of other elements, there is still a lot that I dont know, but I think Im begening to understand the structure of html a bit more and how things should be aranged and put together.

CSS I dont really understand, there dosent really seem to be much order or structure to it, If I am trying to do somthing simple I can get it in a few tries, but anything more complicated just feels like trying to guess.  So far I seem to have done everything that Ive been trying to, even though css stll feels pretty confusing.



### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?

Im not really sure, I guess I new a bit of html and css to begin with, so doing this was a nice refresher, I think that My understanding of how html blocks work is a bit better and how you use css to manipulate the shapes and the layouts.



### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?
using css, its like being in a chaotic vortex where nothing makes sense.
Why is this taking so long, 



### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?
why is this taking so long, nothing is coming together.



### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?
Use wordpress. dont waste your time learning html and css hahaha.
