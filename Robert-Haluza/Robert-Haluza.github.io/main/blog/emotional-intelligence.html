          <h1>How is EQ different to IQ?</h1>
          <p>Intelligence quotient (IQ) is a measure of cognitive ability, or a person's ability to think and reason. It typically measures things like problem-solving, abstract reasoning, and memory.<br>
            While IQ and EQ are related, they are not the same thing and measure different aspects of intelligence. A person can have a high IQ and a low EQ, or vice versa.
