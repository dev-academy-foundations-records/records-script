          <h1>Blocked on a simple problem:</h1>
            <p>
              While working on the the capitalize challenge, I had problems with the function not returning the modified sentence with just the first letter of each word capitalized.<br>
              I used the "debugging" technique to solve the problem. I added console logs to the code and carefully went through each step of the process to see where the issue was. After a while a figured out that I had made a simple error by mislabeling the string. <br>
              I felt a little silly and fustrusted afterwards as it was such simple error that took up to much time to fix and realised afterwards that I just need to keep my cool and apply one of the problem-solving techniques earlier. <br>

          <h1>Elegantly solved a problem:</h1>
          <p>
            Another time, while working on the super-fizz challenge, I was stuck on a problem where the function was still not returning a modifed array. <br>
            I used the "trying something" technique and tested out the .map method, which ended up being giving me the correct output. <br>
            This time I felt pretty good about myself for quickly finding the solution and for trusting my intuition. <br>

          <h1>Reflecting on problem-solving techniques:</h1>
          <p>
            Pseudocode:  Super handy for pre planning a block of code. <br>
            Trying something:  I use this one a lot but not very efficient technique at this stage with my current programming experience.<br>
            Rubber ducky method:  Simple technique that I find helpful with clarifying my thoughts and debugging issues.<br>
            Reading error messages:  Pretty straight forward, I feel like I just need to build up coding experience to be able uitilize this one more effectivly.<br>
            Console.logging:  Super handy for breaking down code and finding issues.<br>
            Googling:  By far my most used technique, a lot of helpful info on the internet.<br>
            Asking your peers for help:  One of the techniques I need to work on and should utilize more.<br>
            Asking coaches for help:  Another technique I need more work on.<br>
            Improving your process with reflection:  I feel Im quite good at being able to step back and analyize my work.<br>
