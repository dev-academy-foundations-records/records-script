      <div class="container">
        <h1>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h1>
        <p>Still not 100% sure what my long term goal is. I would like to work in an environment that would provide me with opportunities to explore different areas of programming and help discover my passions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <h1>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h1>
        <p>I would say that my problem solving skills are still my biggest strength. My focus and self-discipline is still going to be my biggest limitation going into bootcamp as I could potentially mismanage my workload.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <h1>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h1>
        <p>In general I'm not that most social person, so trying involve myself as much as possible in any sort of group projects or activites are probably going to be my biggest challenge.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <h1>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>
        <p>I would realy like to develop my communication skills more, this involves not being afraid to reach out for help when needed and feel more comfortable working with people in a group.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <h1>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h1>
        <p>The same expectations I'd want from any learning facilitators, friendly and approchable, creating an enviroment where I would feel comfortable asking any questions with no judgement.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <h1>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h1>
        <p>To show up everyday and try manage my workload effectively by sticking to a healthy work schedule, completing the assigned course work in a timely manner. If I feel like Im falling behind on my work load, I will reach out to bootcamp facilitator for help.</p>

      <h2>Learning Plan.</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
        <p>If I'm being honest, I'm not to sure what my long term goal is or where exactly I would like to see myself apply my programing skills.
            I guess starting off I would like to get a job and work as a software devloper, ideally somewhere that would help further my learning & skills, and give me the opportunity to figure out what kind of programming I would feel most passionate about.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <h1>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</h1>
        <p>I would say my problem solving skills has always been my biggest strength when it comes to learning. I feel like I can efficiently breakdown any issues I'm having to figure out what is causing the problem.<br>
           My main learning limitations would have to be my focus and self-discipline. I tend to procrastnate a lot while working leading me to usually fall behind schedule rather than properly balancing out workload throughout the week.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <h1>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h1>
        <p>Better time-management skills, so trying to stick to a more fixed work schedule where I'm doing more consistent hours each day and try to use that time as effiecently as possible. 
           Also I'm usually not the most social person, so I would like to try push myself be more open and involved with my peers.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <h1>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:</h1>
        <p>I am commited to planning and scheduling my workload properly throughtout each sprint. I've do this by spliting my work into set study-blocks with regular breaks in between. I find this helps as I'm not exhuasting myself to quickly and/or not overwhelming myself with new info. 
           Trying to do most of the course work during standard work-week hours is important, as being able to communicate and ask for help from others during this time is crucial. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <h1>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h1>
        <p>I do try solve most of the problems myself, usually the first thing I do if I'm stuck on something is to stop and try figure out what the issue is.<br>
          Go back a few steps to see if there was something that had been skipped over that could be causing the problem. <br>
          Then use other resources on the internet to try help find with a soultion. <br>
          If I feel like too much time has been spent trying to fix the problem, I would then ask for help from either the facilitators or other peers.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <h1>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team?</h1>
        <p>I would want my facilitators to be friendly and approchable, creating an enviroment where I would feel comfortable asking any questions with no judgement and is met with good practical advice that help guide you to the answer.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container">
        <h1>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things:</h1>
        <p>I'm lucky I am able to commit myself full-time to the Dev Academy program.</p>
