# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?

Writing down as many notes as possible while going through the course material. 
Poor time managment and lack of focus, need to be more disciplined when im studying and doing the work. 

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

Quite confident, have revised alot of the material.

### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?

Suprisingly, learning how to use and navigate the command line terminal was quite satisfying.

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

The my reflections questions.

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

Needed to spend more time on the coursework through out the day and not just leave more work for the next day.
