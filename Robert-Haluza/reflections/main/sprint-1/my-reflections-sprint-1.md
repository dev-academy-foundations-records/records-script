# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?

Tool where you can use text commands to interact with the computer and perform specific tasks. Like a roadmap, have to follow key roads and markings to reach destination

### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

No, would usually go over the suggested time due to poor time managment. Perhaps try set a timer for each activity and be more strict on sticking within the timebox guidelines.

### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1. $ pwd (Displays path of current working directory)
2. $ cd <directory> (Change directory to <directory>)
3. $ cd.. (Navigate to parent directory)
4. $ ls (List directory content)
5. $ ls -la (List detailed directory contents)


### Did you learn anything unexpected?

How quick and efficient it can be to use command line to navigate through files and directories.

# Version Control with Git 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is a verison control system. A tool used to manage your code history on projects without overwriting others work. While Github is a file hosting service for software develpoment projects and verison control through the Git system.

### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?

Steam and PC games.

### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?

Yes, I feel like there is a clear difference between the two.

### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

No, poor time managment. Need to be more focused when going through the course work.

# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a Git workflow?

A single server-side repository stored on Github that acts as the central codebase where individual developers will push and pull from.

### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

Getting easier to retain and understand the material that I have gone through.
Re-read the course material to see if I had potentially skipped over any key information that would help. 

### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?

Maybe spend a bit more time going through the learning exploration material at the start, rather then constantly going back to that material to find the info needed.


# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?

Like taking the class photo. You get all students arranged on stage, when everything is perfect you press the button to get a photo or snapshot.

# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?

The ideal version of your code, always running correctly.

### Why create a Branch?

To create an enviroment where you can try out new ideas. Changes made to a branch, wont affect the main branch.

### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?  

They feel logical and are straight forward to understand.

# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?

- To use someone elses project as a starting point.
- Propose changes to someone else project.

### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

Forking a repo creates its own private local repo, allowing you to freely experiment with changes without it affecting the orignal project.

# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?

Accidently cloned the repo into another repo.

### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

I was already aware of how websites were made.

# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?

First thing is to stop and try figure out what the problem is.
Go back a few steps to see if something had been skipped over that is causing the problem.
Look through relavant info to try figure out a solution.
If too much time has been spent trying to fix the problem then ask for help.

# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 

Diffcult. Had a hard time balacing coming across fun and casual but still somewhat professional in the introduction.

### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 

Defiently felt self conscious about sharing my thoughts on our values and identity.
