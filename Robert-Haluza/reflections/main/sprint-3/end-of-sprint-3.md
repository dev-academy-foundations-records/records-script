# Final Reflections - Sprint Three 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

Pretty confident, would like to go back to touch up on loops

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?

When the code excuted properly.

### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?

When code wouldnt excute properly all because of something minor like a spelling mistake

### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?

A few times during the Java intro when the code didnt pass properly. Even if Im frustrated and wanted to give up I still end up finding myself trying to figure out the solution.
