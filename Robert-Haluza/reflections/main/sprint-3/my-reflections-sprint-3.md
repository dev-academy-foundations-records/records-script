# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness 

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

One potential bias I have for mindfulness is that it can be a easy fix or solution for most diffuclties or problems. When in reality it comes down to how every person approaches the practice, and how they choose to apply it to everyday life.


### How did you find the overall experience? 

I have practiced before but I always feel relaxed and clear headed after a good breathing session.

### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness? 

Usually will try to do 5-10 mins of meditation first thing in the morning, as I find it easier to contuine or fall back into that state throughout the day. But I do try to practice mindfulness with everything im doing.

# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?

Writing out as many notes as possible helps me memorise a lot of the work.

### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?

Kept within the timebox for all the tasks except loops, spent a bit of extra time to try get a better understanding of the concept.




# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?

 Being able to put the new learnt concepts to practical use was super helpful in seeing how JS interacts with the DOM.

### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?

How crucial it can be to console.log frequently to make sure the code is executing properly.
