# Final Reflections - Sprint Five 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:


### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?

Most of the JavaScript tech challenges were fun and felt super satisfying to complete.

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?

I definitely struggled a lot on the core material, never really had a knack for write ups.

### Was Foundations what you expected it to be like? If not, what was different?

Foundations was kind of what I expected, except for the the heavy empahsis on Core learning work.


### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?

Happend a couple times both with some of the tech work but mainly with the core material. Taking a break or breather and then getting back into with a more refreshed prespective helped a lot.


### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?

I think I'm always going to feel under prepared going into bootcamp, I can build up more confidence by going over the foundation material but I dont think I'll ever feel completely ready.


### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?

No idea. Id hope it says "there is nothing to stress about, you got this".


### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?

No, I feel like I'm barely scratching the surface on what it means to be a programmer and still feel like relying heavily on external resources to complete the work.
