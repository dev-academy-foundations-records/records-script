# Final Reflections - Sprint Four 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

Quite confident, always try make an effort to write down as many notes as possible to help better understand the competencies. I do want go back and spend a bit more time on code readability.

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?

Getting some solutions for the Kata coding challenges correct first try felt super satisfying.

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?

Spending a while trying figure out why the code is not working and it end up being a simple typo on my part.

### How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?

Regular stretching breaks was the main one, I always feel a lot more relaxed and refreshed after spending a bit of time away from the desk.

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say? 

To not overstress when first running into a problem and as usual to try space out my workload better so I'm not rushing to finish it all in the last minute.
