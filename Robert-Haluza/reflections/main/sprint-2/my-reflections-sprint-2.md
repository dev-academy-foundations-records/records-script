Created a blog directory for the html template.
Created a styles directory for the css template.

Definitely manageable, mainly going over the time allocted due to distraction/procrastinating.

Having a more indepth understanding of the DOM.


# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?

I noticed that if tutorial felt like it was going to slow at times, I would end up being distracted. Speeding up the video during these times helped with me staying on task.

### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?

A couple, focused more time in that area to familarise myself with the concepts.

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

At the moment 6 tabs for study and 2 distracted related tabs. 3:1 ratio.

Changed the name of titles around.

# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  

.
### Any moments of surprise or joy? 

When the CSS commands used end up actually doing what you wanted with the element.

### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?

HTML - Earthworms
Super essential, basic ecosystem structure, gets no respect.

CSS - Magpies
Smarter than most people realise, likes nice looking things, can cause a lot of chaos.
