# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?

Fairly confident spent quite a bit of time each task.

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?

Writing up the HTML pages

### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?

When making changes to the CSS file and just hoping the web page isnt in shambles.

### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?

Need to manage workload through the week better and is the blog page any good.



### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?

The basic structure of the site is writing up in a HTML file, while all the flash stuff or styling is done in CSS file.
