# Final Reflections - Sprint Three

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I am not so confident with using the DOM and the loops so during sprint 4, I plan to go back and look at the content again as I really struggled with the latter part of sprint 3. This is most likely because I kept moving on when I vaguely understood a concept.

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?

I struggled a lot during the gameboard DOM buttons to work. Although I haven't fully figured out the invisible counter to go up and down, I was really happy when I made the green and blue buttons to work. (I now realised that it was a typo that prevented it to work!!!)

### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?

After some reflection, I have to say I was most angry at myself for underestimating JS. Never again.

### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?

I wanted to give up when I couldn't get the buttons in the Gameboard DOM to work. I didn't give up because I felt like if the others figured out how to do it then I should be able to too. However, I have to go back and remaster the content.
