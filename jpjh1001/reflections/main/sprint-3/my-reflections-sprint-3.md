# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

Not really, as I think it is a good way to pause and reflect on the current situation.

### How did you find the overall experience?

It was a peaceful experience as I ever really carry out this sort of activity. I thought I'd have the luxury to carry out the exercises when I first started but I totally forgot about it when I started struggling with the coloured dot exercise.

### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness?

I'll try to include the breathing exercise daily so that I can examine my surruondings in a peaceful state.

# Listening and Looping

### What was it like to be fully listened to?

I didn't have a partner this week but I will find a partner for the listening exercise in sprint 4.

### What was it like to fully listen?

# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?

I feel like I need to change my learning style a little bit as I struggled with Javascript this week. I think I need to allocate less break times in between my study sessions to make the most out of my 'concentrated' mode.

### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?

No, I couldn't this time even if I wanted too. I am still stuck on the colored dot part which I intend to start over.

# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?

When Joseph was writing the code, I could follow his coding and his explainations, although I would need to go back and try it again. Yes, his explainations were very clear and after watching video, I realised that had I watched his video when I was stuck with the coloured dot game, I would've been able to progress a little quicker with sprint 3.

### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?

I learned that my way of studying the code this week was quite inefficient. I have to admit I didn't look into the theories I was struggling with which made me panic a little more and I wish to not go through this again. My approach to coding has changed after sprint 3 and I realised I need invest much more time into it.
