# My Reflections - Sprint Two

# Your Blog

<strong>### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?</strong>

From the skillset I learned in sprint 1 (making a directory and a file), I've creates two files, a blog and a styles file.
I believe I will be creating a blog as we progress throughout the course and the work would be saved on the blog file.
The styles file contains a .css file which help would eventually help me make the blog website more appealing to look at.

<strong>### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?</strong>

This one was easily achievable as I did not struggle with the instructions.

# Learn HTML and CSS

<strong>### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</strong>

I did a little bit of work prior to Dev Academy on CSS and HTML so there weren't too many obstacles that I came across. When I did though, I had to look up the meaning of an element in order to better understand what the function really is doing.

<strong>### What are of you proud of from this challenge?</strong>

I'm proud of remembering the stuff that I worked on prior to foundations, as well as learning new elements on code academy.

# DevTools Tutorial

<strong>### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?</strong>

I noticed that I was trying to replicate what the youtuber was doing as he changed the elements on the vscode. I guess a stregnth would be that I tried to use what I learned immediately so that I am going at the same pace as the youtuber. However, this meant that sometimes, I was just copying with he was doing without really understanding much (near the end of the video).

<strong>### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?</strong>
Yes, I lost track after he finished explaining the console.log elements, so I watched the whole video the second time.

<strong>### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?</strong>

I have 8 tabs open and 6/8 are related to the dev academy course.

<strong>### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.</strong>
Yeah, being able to alter websites that I always use was pretty fun to look at. But also I realised there were so many elements that I need to know in order to build an aesthetic website

# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

<strong>### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.</strong>

I'd like to think that HTML is the human body and CSS is like the clothing/accessories/hairstyle that we use to decorate ourselves. Although HTML is able to funciton without CSS but with it exists unlimited possibilities that it could be designed.

Just like how an image of a person changes depending on how they dress (besides their manner), with CSS a simple webpage could look very plain or extremely appealing to look at.

<strong>### Any moments of surprise or joy?</strong>

Joy came from the fact that by writing few lines of code, it helps me to turn a plain webpage by using it as a sketch board to make it the way I want it to appear (although the process takes ages,,, for now!).

<strong>### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?</strong>

I would like to think HTML as a shark and CSS as the fish that swim underneath the sharks. Because one of the things that the small fishes do is that it cleans the sharks skin simply by eating parasites on it. They also clean the sharks teeth (kinda like flossing) from its leftovers. This helps the shark to stay healthy and very appealing (daunting) to look at!
