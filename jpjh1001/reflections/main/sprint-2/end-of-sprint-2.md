# Final Reflections - Sprint Two

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?

About 7/10. I think I did an okay job buidling a blog using the basic elements of css.

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?

When I wrote the code and it turned out just the way I wanted it to be. Although I wanted to add more effects like having the nav bar scroll down with me as I went down the page but I think I'll be happy with what I have for now.

### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?

Surprisingly this sprint didn't make me feel anxious much. Just seeing couple of my peers blog made me think that they were outstanding.

### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?

Just keep on going when I got stuck making the webpage. I don't think I have much of a critical voice in my head.

### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?

To make a local website, all you need is a html and css template and by writing some codes, you could be on your way.
