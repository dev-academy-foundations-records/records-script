# Final Reflections - Sprint Five

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?

when I was understanding the content, and when the code I wrote actually worked.

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?

I think I had a hard time just learning the content online, just reading the instructions and meanings to methods etc all online didn't feel so good as there was no human interaction.

### Was Foundations what you expected it to be like? If not, what was different?

I thought I'd be able to study online smoothly but it wasn't the case as there were numerous times when I had urging questions to ask but I didn't because I needed a response right away.

### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?

There were many times I'd wanted to give especially starting sprint 4. Because there were some people excelling and working on the stretch materials when i was still stuck on the first couple of exercises. I kept on going because I knew there were people around me when I needed help. My tutors and my peers in my cohort offered me a lending hand when I asked for one.

### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?

No I do not feel entirely ready going into bootcamp. I spent the last week (week 6) trying to finish off sprint 5. I now have a few days left before bootcamp stars so I am planning to go over all the materials again, and try solve the same questions again to have a better understanding before bootcamp actually starts.

### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?

I hope it says, I know you struggled a lot during foundations which made you feel down and sometimes even stupid. But now you know your stuff and have well absorbed the content taught by dev academy and you are more than ready to be employed as a front end developer!

### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?

Sometimes, I felt like a programmer but thats when the codes work. Most of the times I don't because I know this isn't even the beginning of what a programmer truly does which makes me feel nervous yet a little excited getting into bootcamp. This is because I know it will be more intense but we will be taught SO much content.
