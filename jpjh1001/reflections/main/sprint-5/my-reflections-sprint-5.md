# My Reflections - Sprint Five

# Tic-Tac-Toe

### What was the most challenging part of this exercise for you?

Lacking in the fundamentals, I had and still have a little bit of trouble merging the concepts together. I think I approached the foundations wrongly as I moved on when I got the correct answers, however, I should've spent more time understanding the concept in depth.

### What learning(s) are you going to takeaway from this exercise?

To not only be satisfied by getting an answer but to fully understand how I got to the answer.

# Pair Programming

### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?

No, I had no prior experience of pair coding and however this experinece was new as I realised explaining my code to someone else was quite different to when I was writing them out.

### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during Bootcamp? Why so?

No, I think it would be more fun and that I'd become more productive when working with others. Because when I say out a concept which I don't understand, it sometimes helps me to understand it better. This being the case, I think working with others in bootcamp would be much better than online learning.

# Inflate the Unicorn

### Did you learn anything new during this exercise? What was it?

Yes, able able to change the image and using a loop to do so.

### Did you encounter issues completing any of the steps of this exercise? How did you resolve this?

I encountered a lot of issues probably because I didn't understand how to merge the concepts taught during foundations. I had to get Lani to help me out with the bits I'm stuck with as well as asking my peers.

### If you were to replace the unicorn with another mystical animal of your choice, what would it be?

I would maybe replace it with big foot.

# Whack-a-mole

### What was the hardest part of this exercise?

I skipped this as I realised I wouldn't have time to meet the deadline. However, I will definitely give this an attempt before the bootcamp stars.

### Can you think of any different ways you could have accomplished the same outcome?

# Dress the Clown

### How did you find the process of refactoring your code?

Again, it has been a challenge and because I was already behind, refactoring the code was even more stressful for me.

### Would you do anything differently if you were to start this challenge again?

I'd like to answer this question as if I were to start foundations again. I would dig deeper into the concepts taught and ask more questions when I am stuck and not struggle alone for days and eventually be behind the class.

### What piece of code are you proudest of from this exercise?

When I figured out how to code using the arrow keys.

# JS Carnival

### What parts of these challenges did you enjoy? If we were to add more challenges, what would you like to have more of?

I enjoyed the part when I actually finished and made them to function! I think I wouldn't dare to add any more challenges at my level for now as I struggled during bootcamp

### What parts weren't so good? Were there any parts that you felt stuck on?

When I felt the instructions weren't clear. I could see that the readMe file was technically giving me the answers, but when I couldn't comprehend them made me feel a little down.

### Which parts made you feel confident?

Imagining the coding in my head! Like pseudocoding what I am about to do, but felt down when I couldnt execute them.

### What personally would you want changed to improve the carnival?

I think just reaching out to people when I got stuck rather than trying to solve the entire problem myself and then panicking later on as I felt behind.
