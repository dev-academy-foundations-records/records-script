# My Reflections - Sprint One

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

<strong>### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it? </strong>

Command line is a the control centre that can takes commands to operate which in turn allows you to run any thing that you could with the mouse and more.
I think best analogy for this would be the master key.

<strong>### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?</strong>
No, I think I work in a different pace to the timebox guidelines so I just kept to my own schedule. I think I would consider using the timebox guideline in the future to see whether I could truly complete the task within the set time.

<strong>### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.</strong>

1. git branch -> creates a branch from the main branch
2. git clone -> creates a clone of the remote branch to my local branch.
3. git log -> I was able to see the
4. command k -> clearing the terminal.
5. touch (type of file) -> creates a file.

<strong### Did you learn anything unexpected?></strong>

Yes, I never knew forking a repo and then working it on a local computer then requesting for it to be pulled back existed.

# Version Control with Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

<strong>### What's the difference between git and GitHub?</strong>
git is a tool to make edits on a file with few codes. With git, you can track the history of the files altered, when and how it was done. I can work on many different versions with git, without changing the original file.
Github is like a server on the cloud that allows many programmers to collectively work together.

<strong>### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?</strong>
Github is like an online game where everyone can meet on one particular server whereas git is more like an offline game where what you do doesn't really affect anybody else.

<strong>### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?</strong>
Yes, and I truly hope so.

<strong>### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?</strong>

Again, because I wanted to work at my own pace.

# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

<strong>### What is a Git workflow?</strong>

A guide to how to collectively work together in a team.

<strong>### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?</strong>

It was really challenging at first, and it is but I decided to start from scratch on day five of week one because I felt like I was just reading words and never really absorbing the content even though I was making progress thanks to the guidelines. I noticed that I tried to stay calm while being stressed as it was evident that my pace was slower than others.

<strong>### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?</strong>

I think I would just sit down and turn all my phones on do not disturb mode from sprint two as my phone was the biggest distracting factor.

# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

<strong>### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?</strong>

I would say,

in order for you to put a file online (to the cloud) you have to go through a few processes.
Like checking for your identification at the airport when you drop your bags off and again having to hand over your passport before scanning your check in bags.

First step to putting a file online would be to stage the file. This would be done with git add. (first part of checking my identity at the bag drop off area).
Second step would be to committing the file with the command git commit. This is just another verification process to ask myself whether I actually want to go ahead with the file being uploaded online. (handing over your passport before scanning your check in bags.)

# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

<strong>### What is main?</strong>
Main is the master branch. The root of something. To be at the main of something means to be at the centre of a certain repo.

<strong>### Why create a Branch?</strong>
So that I can test out my ideas on a branch to the main and if I think it is worthy of merging to the main, then I would request git merge.

<strong>### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?</strong>

At first it definitely was and it still is. I believe I would have to go back and re-read sprint one after handing my work for this week. Because I believe fundamentals are the most important part to anything.

# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

<strong>### What are some examples of when you would fork?</strong>

When I want to completely replicate something from the remote server to my own local server to work on a particular project and insert my ideas without having to get permission from the original owner to make changes until I decide to make a pull request.

<strong>### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?</strong>

Yes, after restarting from the beginning when I was still stuck on learning and understanding the git commands, I just gave up and re-read everything from the get-go and it clicked. The theory and the explanation and the steps suddenly clicked.

# Setup Repo & Create Blog

<strong>### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?</strong>

I felt frustrated when I used the command git push index.html to try push the index.html file up to the github and it didn't work. Before searching how to do in on google, I read what it said on the terminal and just simply tried out git push and it worked!

<strong>### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?</strong>

I thought I had to code the html file myself on the vs code then put it live on to the server. I didn't know I could build a website off of github.
It seemed more simpler than I imagined.

# Thinking like a programmer

<strong>### What is your process so far for solving problems?</strong>

So far, I would follow the instructions given. If that doesn't seem to work for me, I'll try searching on either youtube or on google to figure out the solution. If those don't work, then I will ask my peers on the discord server.

# Introduce yourself

<strong>
### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?</strong>

It was a little weird introducing myself online to not only a few people but few hundred people who had access to the discord server. But I am really excited to meet them face to face at bootcamp.

<strong>### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?</strong>

No and I was not self conscious at all!
