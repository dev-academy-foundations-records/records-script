# Final Reflections - Sprint One

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

<strong> ### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? </strong>

To try again when I was stuck as it cleared up my mind and helped me to understand the content better. I think I wasn't fully in the zone and seeing everybody write their instructions on discord made me panic a little bit.

<strong>### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?</strong>

I am quite confident with most areas in sprint 1, but I may need to go back and understand forking again.

<strong>### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?</strong>

When the git commands I was using actually made sense!

<strong>### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?</strong>

With all the sentences popping out on github. And when the code I put in did not work even after trying multiple times.

<strong>### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?</strong>

I just thought that I had to keep going and cannot fall behind, espcially in week 1 of foundations!
