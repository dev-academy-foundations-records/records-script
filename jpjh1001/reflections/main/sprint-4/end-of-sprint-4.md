# Final Reflections - Sprint Four

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I am a little more confident than when I first started

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?

When I got the green ticks...

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?

When I spent a whole day writing out a single function to work. This happened on numerous occasions and sometimes it was just a few typos..

### How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?

I take breaks when my brain has had its limits

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say?

If I could go back to the beginning of foundations, I would say ask early rather than trying to solve it youself.
