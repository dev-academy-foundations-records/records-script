# My Reflections - Sprint Four

# Code Readability

### What makes code more readable for you?

When the codes are written neatly, that is easy to follow with appropriate names used.

### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?

I prefer tabs as it's just one single button resulting in four spaces.

### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?

I only have things that I need to use daily on the desk and everything else is put away.
I guess so as I aim to write out codes that are simplistic.

# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    let expected = 7
    let actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```

### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`:

function sum (a,b) {

    let digitOne = 5
    let digitTwo = 6

    if (digitOne + digitTwo == 11) {
      console.log("It works!")
    } else {
      console.log("Oops!")
    }

return (a+b)
}

sum (5+6)

```

```

### Do you think you would prefer using Test Driven Development? Why?

From reading the notes on the handbook, for now I prefer unit testing because by making indvidiual functions to work, I'd be able to utilise these as tools to draw a bigger programme. Because I think when small things work, they generally add up and also make bigger things work.

# Kata

### How did you find using repl.it in practice? Confusing? Useful?

I used codepen instead and I think it was useful to test out whether my code was working or not

### Was it helpful to look at the tests while coding the kata?

Yes, I looked at it at for the built-in methods while getting help from Lani (Thank you!!)

### What problem solving techniques did you implement in your coding flow?

I struggled A LOT in sprint 4 and I think saying out what I wanted to do then writing it out helped me out a little.

### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?

Understading the methods, creating a function while combining one method with another! And also trying to understand the descriptions on the internet. Everything was just so hard

### Did you want to change and refactor your code once you were finished?

I think I will try to do this in the revision week so that I am well prepared for foundations.
