# My Reflections - Sprint Four 

# Code Readability

### What makes code more readable for you?
indentation makes code more readable 


### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?
tabs


### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?

not really 




# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    let expected = 7
    let actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```
### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`: 
```
funtion sum(x,y){
  let Sum = x + y
  return Sum
}
```

### Do you think you would prefer using Test Driven Development? Why?
yes. i would make my mind more clearly before i start writing the code.
