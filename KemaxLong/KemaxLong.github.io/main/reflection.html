      <li>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</li>
      <p>Ghosting someone might be a ethical decison that i have made. when i was youger, i used to end up a relatihonship by not responding to the my friend at all, by just ignoring them,rather than telling them i would like to the relationship. Ghosting seems like the easy way out for the one ghosting, but it's hard for the one being ghosted to find closure and move on</p>
      <li>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</li>
      <p>“We Chinese believe that humility is a kind of virtue. We have an old proverb that says “Pride leads to loss, while modesty brings benefit.” So, one shouldn't praise oneself. When we talk about ourselves or our things we usually do it in self-effacing terms.</p>
      <li>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</li>
      <p>I think my best strength is being a team player. I enjoy working in a team environment, and I get along well with people. I think it's also a great process in that team members with certain strengths balance out people with certain weaknesses and we can all learn from each other</p>
      <li>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</li>
      <p>I tend to focus too much on the details, which means I sometimes get curious and distracted by a little thing of a project – In my uni life, sometimes I can end up spending one or two hours reading something that’s only very slightly relevant to the project.</p>
      <li>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</li>
      <p>I once disagreed with my boss over how to best help a customer. Rather than question his authority in front of everyone, I talked to him off of the floor. I was open and honest about the problems I had with the way he wanted to do things. It turned out that there was just a simple misunderstanding. That disagreement we had showed me the importance of communicating with my coworkers to make sure that something obsolete doesn’t become a bigger problem than it needs to be.</p>

        <h2 class="research-q">Reflections sprint 3 - Emotional Intelligence</h2>
        <p>EQ, or emotional intelligence, refers to a person's ability to understand and manage their own emotions and the emotions of others. It involves skills such as empathy, self-awareness, self-regulation, and social awareness.
        </p>
        
        <p>IQ, on the other hand, refers to a person's cognitive intelligence or intellectual ability. It is often measured by standardized tests and is an indicator of a person's ability to reason, solve problems, and think abstractly.

        </p>
        <P>EQ is important because it plays a crucial role in our personal and professional lives. People with high EQ are typically better at building and maintaining relationships, managing conflict, and communicating effectively. They are also more resilient, have better mental health, and are more successful in their careers.

        </P>
        <p>For me personally, developing my EQ is important because I want to be a well-rounded individual who is able to understand and connect with others. I believe that having strong emotional intelligence will help me to build stronger relationships, both personally and professionally, and to be a more effective communicator. Additionally, having high EQ will help me to better regulate my own emotions and respond to stress in a healthy and productive way.

        <h2 class="research-q">Reflections sprint 4 - Mindset</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Understanding Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset:</li>
          <p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to change and adapt over time in response to experience. It refers to the idea that the brain is not fixed and rigid, but rather, it is flexible and capable of reorganizing itself throughout our lives.
            Growth mindset, on the other hand, is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed and improved through effort and dedication. This mindset is opposed to a fixed mindset, which is the belief that abilities and intelligence are set and cannot be changed.
            Together, neuroplasticity and growth mindset play a crucial role in shaping our learning and development. By embracing a growth mindset and believing in our ability to learn and grow, we can take advantage of neuroplasticity to rewire our brains and develop new skills and abilities.
            As a learner, I am constantly working to adopt a growth mindset and to believe in my ability to grow and develop. I believe that every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow, and that by putting in the time and effort, I can develop new skills and abilities.
            By understanding neuroplasticity, I am also able to appreciate the importance of repetition and practice in shaping my brain and developing new skills. I know that the more I practice, the more my brain will adapt and change, and the more I will be able to learn and grow.

        <ol>
          <li>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</li>
          <p> I've learned that I tend to compete with myself, that everyone learns differently, and the importance of listening to others. These insights have helped me better understand my own learning style and approach, and how to work effectively with others.</p>
            
          <li>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</li>
          <p>The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming: Values, empathy, and self-awareness play a crucial role in learning and programming. Values provide a sense of purpose and direction, while empathy helps us understand and connect with others. Self-awareness helps us recognize our strengths and limitations, and make informed decisions about our learning and development.</p>
          <li>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</li>
          <p> I was surprised by the number of typos I made and how challenging it was to familiarize myself with the code language and methods. These challenges have helped me appreciate the value of perseverance and the importance of seeking help when needed.</p>
          <li>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</li>
          <p>The most challenging aspect of the core learning for me has been trying to fully understand all the concepts. This is a common challenge in any type of learning, but by continuing to practice, seek help, and stay persistent, I am confident that I will master these concepts and become a more proficient coder.</p>
          <li>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</li>
          <p>I believe that a programming school spends a significant amount of time on core learning in a web development bootcamp course because it provides the foundation for effective and efficient coding. By understanding core concepts and practices, I can approach coding with a deeper understanding and a better ability to problem-solve.
          </p>
          <li>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</li>
          <p> i do not feel that the time spent studying core learning is a waste of time. In fact, I believe it has been an essential part of my learning journey, as it has provided me with a solid foundation and helped me understand the underlying principles of coding.
          </p>
          <p>The time spent on core learning is not a waste of time because it provides the foundation for effective and efficient coding. Without a solid understanding of core concepts and practices, I may struggle to apply my coding skills effectively and may experience frustration and burnout. By taking the time to study core learning, I can approach coding with a deeper understanding and a better ability to problem-solve.</p>
