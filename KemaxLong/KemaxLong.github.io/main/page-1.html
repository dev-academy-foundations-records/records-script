      <p class="research-q">What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</p>

      <p class="center-words">Classes and ids are all selectors that is used in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</p>
      <p class="center-words">Seletors allows you to taget specific elements on a web page that you can apply styles to.</p>
      <p class="center-words">The ID selector is the "the King of all the selector", which mean it will overiders other selectors </p>
      <p class="center-words">so the best practices is to define style rules that apply to a single element on the web page</p>

    </div>
    <p class="research-q">How do you apply classes and ids in HTML and css</p>
    <p>ID selectors are defined using a hash sign. They are immediately followed by the ID value that you want to apply a set of style rules to. Here is an example of the ID selector in action:</p>
    <p class="center-words"><img src="../styles/Ids-css.png" alt="blog-pic" width="300" height="100">      <img src="../styles/ids-html.png" alt="blog-pic" width="500" height="100">
    
    </p>
    <p class="center-words">
       This style applies to the p element in our HTML document with the ID "email . The style will set  the color of the text in the element to black and potition to center, the font size to 10px
      </p>
      <p>Class selectors are defined using a period, followed by the value of the class that you want to apply a set of styles to. Here’s an example of the class selector in action:</p>
      <p class="center-words"><img src="../styles/class-css.png" alt="blog-pic" width="300" height="100">      <img src="../styles/class-html.png" alt="blog-pic" width="500" height="100">></p>
      <p class="center-words">This style sets the background color of our div tag to lightgreen. </p>

      <li>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</li>
      <p>it like a house. HTMl is the structure of the house. CSS is the decoration of house. JavaScript will be the furniture and electricity of the house which make the house more livable  </p>
      <li>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).</li>
      <p>Control flow is like driving a car. Frist, you need to have a car and start the engine, then driving. The loop is like the repetition of the "driving process" </p>
      <li>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</li>
      <p> The DOM is document as nodes and object. you can just use "document.getElement" to obtaine and motify the element thru JavaScript</p>
  
         
      <li>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</li>
      <p>I tend to focus too much on the details, which means I sometimes get curious and distracted by a little thing of a project – In my uni life, sometimes I can end up spending one or two hours reading something that’s only very slightly relevant to the project.</p>
      <li>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</li>
      <p>Arry is list of data and stored in Order. Object contains multiple values in a single variable.</p>
      <li>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful</li>
      <p>Functions is like different furniture in a house which performs a particular task.</p>
