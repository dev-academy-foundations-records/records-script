  <h2 class="research-q">Learning Plan for Bootcamp </h2>
  <ol>
    <ul>
      <li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>
      <p>My long-term goal is to become a full-time coder and pursue a career in web development. I believe that the 2-month bootcamp will provide me with the foundation I need to achieve this goal.</p>
      <li>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</li>
      <p>As for my strengths and limitations, I think my biggest strength is my ability to work well in a team. I'm a strong communicator and enjoy collaborating with others on projects. My limitation is that I tend to be a bit negligent at times, so I'll need to be mindful of this and make a conscious effort to stay on track.</p>
      <li>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</li>
      <p>I believe that my biggest non-technical challenge during the bootcamp will be time management. With so much material to cover in such a short period of time, I'll need to stay focused and organized in order to keep up.</p>
      <li>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
      <p>In terms of non-technical skills, I'd like to develop my public speaking abilities during the bootcamp. I hope to become more confident and comfortable speaking up in class and participating in group discussions.</p>
      <li>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</li>
      <p>I have high expectations for the bootcamp team. I hope that they are friendly and supportive, and that they provide a positive and collaborative learning environment. I also hope that they have a wealth of knowledge and experience to share with us, and that they are dedicated to helping us achieve our goals.,</p>
      <li>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</li>
      <p>Finally, I have high expectations for myself on the bootcamp. I plan to stay focused and dedicated, and to put in the time and effort necessary to succeed. I hope to take full advantage of this opportunity and come out of the bootcamp with a solid foundation in web development.</p>
