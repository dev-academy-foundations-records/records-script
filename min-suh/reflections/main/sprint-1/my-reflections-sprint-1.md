# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
Command line is a text command used to nevigate through text interface on a computer. It's a progamm that takes in the text command.


### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
I have used the timebox guidelines to track my study time. 


### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1.	ls – lists all directory / files within current directory.
2.	Cd – changes directory.
3.	Cd .. – Move up in file directory.
4.	Touch – creates a file.
5.	Mkdir – creates new directory file.


### Did you learn anything unexpected?
Up until this point, I had no idea that terminal is a text version of GUI. 


# Version Control with Git 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a version control software where developers can track and manage different versions of a project and allows multiple developers to work collaboratively on a same project. Github is an internet service that provides distributed version control to its users and provides central point access.


### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
Github is a company head-office. Git would be branches of that company. Branches operates themselves for day to day operations but they do report income/expenses at the end of earning period ??. This is the best analogy I can come up with. 


### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
I do think that I will remember the difference as it is an essential service and software that developers are using to work on a project.


### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
Yes, I have stuck to the timebox suggestions.


# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a Git workflow?
Best/most convinent ways to use git (best practices). 


### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
I have noticed that I don't neccesarily understand materials when I first encounter them. When I'm blocked or confuced, I go back to materials I read before and it tends to make more sense then.


### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
I can't think of any at the moment. I will record if anything comes up in the future here.


# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?
If I were to compare git to a cooking, staging would be like preping your ingredient and commiting is cooking itself.


# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?
Main is a refering to default branch when a new repsoitory is created. 


### Why create a Branch?
Branch is created from main to try different thing on a project without interfering with the main version of a project. Once trial has been verified on branches, it then can be merged with the main.


### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?  
Concepts introduced feels bit confucing at times. I'm hoping that things will make sense as I move through the course.


# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?
Folk would be used in open source projects or when a user do not have direct access to the main repo. 



### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?
No yet.


# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?
I felt frustration when I cloned repo. I created directory and then cloned repo in there. Cloning created another directory within my directory which was not what I wanted. I had to delete the whole directory and then clone repo again. 


### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?
Alothough I had some idea how website is built (html/css/js), I did not know how a website to be deployed on the internet. I honestly have not given a much thought on how a website would be deployed on internet before. 





# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?
Before I read 'thinking like a programmer' section on foundation, I had tendency to jump right into a problem instead of planning ahead on how to approach it. Sometimes it worked without any problems but other times, it created unforseen problems for me. Now, I understand the importance of planning ahead when encountered with a problem so that I can approch them tactically.   




# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 
I always has been a shy person. It was quite uncomfortable for me to summarise myself to a group of strangers.


### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 
I'm not too sure what it means to feel my ego but definetley self conscious when introducing myself.
