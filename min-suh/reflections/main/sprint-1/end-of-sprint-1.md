# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?
Sticking with suggested time line for each part of work helped with me my time management. However, sometimes I felt bit pressured to finish material within the time that I would skip some part just to meet to timeline. I then had to go back to some materials afterwards to fully understand them.


### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
I am bit confident with the learning competencies although feels like I'm missing someone things. I'm sure I will get the hand of git and command line as the course progresses.


### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?
I enjoyed learning how to use command line as well as git.


### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
Not applicable.


### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
When I watched the video on git for the first time. I had so many question around git that I felt overwelmed. I felt like I had to understand it on the spot. I shaked that feeling off and started exploring git on my own to answer my own questions.
