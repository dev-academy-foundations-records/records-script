### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?
I'm finding working with the timeboexes quite useful in tracking my time on assignments. Although, tracking my time on an assignment does put pressure on me to finish the task on time which can be stressful at times.




# Learn HTML and CSS 

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?
I did not understand certain aspects of CSS, namely media query, even after finishing the freeCodeCamp tutorial. I researched online on the topic to see other examples and uses to gain a deeper understanding of it which I'm hoping that I can utilise in my future assignments. 


### What are of you proud of from this challenge?
I feel like I gained a solid foundation in HTML and CSS while having fun!.




# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?
I noticed that I understand materials much faster when I do things rather than just watching tutorials. I found my limitation when the tutorial went into the console section of the Chrome Dec tool as I have not done much work on JS. I could not understand what was happening on the screen.


### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?
As mentioned in the previous answer, I could not understand the console part of the chrome Devtool tutorial. I'm planning on coming back to the part again once I gain more understanding in JS.


### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
I had around 5-6 tabs opened while working on DevTools tutorial. Most of the tabs were study related ;)


### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.
I did. I typed in 'Michael is awesome' on Dev Acedemy student handbook website heading section. 



# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  



### Any moments of surprise or joy? 



### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?
