# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?
I had problems installing/preparing my pc for this course.
Additional problem was time - it took me more than double I had expected to complete all the tasks.


### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
So so, I think that I need more practice.



### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?
Learning new things.


### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
Perhaps, typing longer bits of text and 
spell checking it - being sure there are no mistakes.


### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

Yes, it said the material is too hard and tedious. No.
