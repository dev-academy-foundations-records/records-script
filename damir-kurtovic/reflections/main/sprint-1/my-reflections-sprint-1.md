# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?

The command line is a space/screen/window where we type commands. It is one of the ways to use/program a computer. The other way we could use a computer is by clicking on icons (text, pictures, etc.) - grafical user interface. The command line is a type of a program used to operate a computer by typing text/commands. Analogies: 1) using a ATM to withdraw money ; 2)seting up a washing mashine; 3) setting up any other appliance/machine.

### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
No, I fell behind and I did not keep the track of the time spent.


### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1. ls - lists files in a folder/directory
2. code . - opens VisualStudioCode text editor
3. cd ..- goes up one directory/folder
4. pwd - shows/prints the path of the current directory
5. Explorer.exe . - opens current folder/ dircetory in Windows Explorer

### Did you learn anything unexpected?

What suprises me is that it is possible to have different time versions of the same name file on github.com -instead of different file names as I am used to.

# Version Control with Git 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is a software/program, it is a distributed version control software system, a device/mechanism that supports collaboratively creating/writing programs.
On the other hand github is a website that acts as the host/storage where software(projects) are kept. Github is a platform, like a hard drive on pc where software code is kept.

### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
Analogies : Github is like hard drive/memory on a computer, or like a storage warehouse for programs/code. Git is like mechanic workshop or factory, a place where something is produced, made, fixed,etc.


### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
Yes, for me github means github.com - something (as it is a website) for hosting, storage.
Git for me is typing commands in the terminal starting with 'git'.


### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
No, I watched 'Code School: Git Real' videos and searched/read about git and github online.


# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a Git workflow?
A Git workflow is a way that / how we use Git. It is a recipe how to use Git to work/program productivly. 


### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
1) I am suprised how much more time it takes to complete the given tasks.
2) I would take a break.

### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
1) start ealrier in a day
2) study in 30 minutes chuncks
3) start earlier in a week/month
4) update/get ready my laptop before a course starts



# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?
Git keeps track of all versions of a file. Saving a chanage is done by a process of a 'stage and commit'. When change (in a file) has been saved it is called 'commit'. Commit is like history (something happened/finished), on the other hand 'stage' is like having the options available (possible to change). Stage is the first step in the "stage and commit" process, for it we use 'add' command to add a (changed/work in progress) file to be ready to be commited. To commit a file means that a change has been completed/finalised.


# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?

Main (branch) is the best version of a code in a repository.

### Why create a Branch?

Creating branch allows us to try/make changes to a code we are working on. 
Our co-workers should review the code before it's merged into main.

### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?
The concepts feel intuitive.



# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?
1) When we want to copy someone else's repository into our github account.
2) To give every programmer their own server-side repository.
3) Forked repository could be developed into a separate project.



### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?
Yes, I did. It happened today when I was answering the questions for 'Ko Wai Koe' challenge. All the material from Sprint 1 become clear and connected.


# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?
Creating index.html file and adding the given text was straightforward. I had problems to push the changes for index.html to GitHub.



### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

My understanding (before doing this course) how websites are made was:
- write/code .html , .css, etc files in the code editor (like sublime or notepad++)
- launch .html files from the text editor into the internet browser
- keep all files on local/our computer
- if we want to have a live site use web hosting
- web hosting company puts our site on the internet


# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?
1) I think about a problem - ask "What is really my problem?". Often I skip this as I have some idea about a problem.
2) Try solution that I will work, oe ask someone for help, by either telling them what the problem is or ask for the solution.
3) Try different solution is the first one did nor work.
4) Keep trying next solution, etc.


# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 
My name is Damir, I live in Auckland. 
Mt top values include: love of learning, curiosity, love, creativity, humility, bravery, spirituality and appreciation of beauty and excellence.
I like to learn new things, to expand my knowledge, to have new experiences, taking this bootcamp is a part of that. 
My identity is shaped by 2 main influnces: 1) traditional Balkan culture and 2) contemporary western culture.
I was born in ex Yugoslavia, and lived there until my late teens when my parents(and I) moved to NZ.
1) Traditional values that I accepted include: hard work, keeping one's words, honour, hospitality, collectivism, etc. 2) Contemporary western culture - I was exposed to it even during my life in Yugoslavia through American movies, songs, books, etc. Now, living in New Zealand, I am additionally accepting its values, such as individuality, privacy, personal responsibility equality, pursuit of wealth and success, etc. 
I am attending this course in order to change my career, i.e. to be web developer in the future.
My short to medium term goals include working as a freelancer and/or being company employee.
### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 
I think I could. 
Maybe thoghts/behaviours such as negativity, complaining, being judgamental, etc show that ego is influencing me.
