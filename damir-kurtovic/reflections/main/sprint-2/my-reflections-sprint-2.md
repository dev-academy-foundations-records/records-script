# Your Blog 

### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?
0) opening/navigating to the correct directory to start work/coding
1) typing commands to create folders and files
2) copying and pasting code to files
3) saving changes, both localy and online/on github.com
4) cheking how files look/work with the internet browser 



### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?
I manage to complete the tasks within the recommended timeframe.


# Learn HTML and CSS 

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?
To keep going over the assigned tasks, day after day. The first couple of days I spend around 7 to 8 hours studying, from the fourth day I am looking for reasons to be away from my computer. I overcome this by taking 10 minutes break after each 30 to 40 minutes on studying.


### What are of you proud of from this challenge?
That I completed with the 100% success 3 freecodecamps courses.
Lerned how to navigate the DOM. 

# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?
The best time for me to study is in the afternoon, and early evening time. 
Between 3pm and 9pm.
My strengths include: love of learning, curiosity, creativity, and appreciation of beauty and excellence.
Attending Foundations is directly connected to my strengths. I like to learn new things, to expand my knowledge, to have new experiences, taking this bootcamp is a part of that. 
My main limitation is poor time managament. That really showed during Sprint 2.


### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?
The block that was affecting me was procrastination / taking too long breaks from study.
Firstly, I kept postponing the start of doing my course work.
Secondly, I was taking the breaks as long as my study time i.e. 
I was studying 30 minutes, then I stopped for 30 to 35 minutes.
On Thursday and Friday, I started to study earlier in the morning, around 9:00 am and continued to study
until the night time around 10:00pm. I kept my breaks to 15 minutes.



### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
I have 3 browser windows open. The total number of tabs is 188.
Out of that 55 are not study related.
Many of the tabs are at sleep - they start loading when I click on them.

### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.
I only changed some headings using the DOM.



# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  
An HTML file contains/gives the structure of the page. HTML is a skeleton of a web page.
A CSS file contains the styling(look and formatting) of the page. 
We can change colours, positioning, etc. by using CSS.


### Any moments of surprise or joy? 
I was suprised how much differntly the same HTML code looks with the small changes in a CSS code.


### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?
We could compare HTML with the worker honey bees.When they produce honey, they are well organised, each bee knows what to do, how to do it, and to be an efficient team player. Similarly, HTML gives page organisation, each tag has its own function.
CSS could be compared to the peacock (bird). (Male) peacock spreads its coulorful tail.
He looks very different with the open tail, similarly CSS adds colours/style to HTML.
