# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

My bias could be thinking that mindfulness is a kind of artificial.
Because, a person needs to constantly check on themselves.
As "Mindfulness is a technique which involves noticing what's happening in the present moment, without judgement."
I think that distracts us from the tasks we need to do.
Secondly, it could make us passive and complacent as we get used to observing situations/behaviours/thoughts 'without
judgement', we keep finding excuses and/for tolerating them.

### How did you find the overall experience?

I came into contact with mindfulness about 4 or 5 years ago.
I had a back injury, and my specialist sent me to the physiotherapy clinic that had one medical researcher
who was teaching mindfulness. One session consisted of 2 parts. The first part was with that researcher,
it was planned as to teaching people the pain reducing/coping strategies, the second part was a 'normal' physiotherapy
session with the other person/physiotherapist. I actually used the mindfulness part to reduce my unhappiness in my day to day life. Talking to the researcher helped me to understand better my actions, and be happier.
I found it much easier going through the mindfulness process with somebody else
(with a medical researcher at the time).
Maybe, on my own I could use mindfulness to defuse anger, make myself a bit more relaxed,
in a situation when I am distressed.

### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness?

Stopping what I am doing and checking my thoughts and feelings 3 times a day.
Firstly, before starting my study tasks, secondly before lunch,
thirdly in the second part of the afternoon (between 5 and 6 pm).

# Listening and Looping

### What was it like to be fully listened to?

It felt good that my partner put his attention on what I said.
It was a bit unusual that my partner was silent all the time, as
I started to lose focus of what I was talking about.
Overall it was a good experience as I felt that my partner took me seriously, that made me feel important.

### What was it like to fully listen?

It made me alert, as I kept reminding myself to remember what I heard.
My partner talked about the similar/same problems that I had, so I kept thinking that I am doing ok (with the coursework).

# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?

It works for me to take breaks after 30 to 40 minutes of study.
I worked in spurs/chunks. I had times when I completed 4-5 questions in a row, without difficulty.
Contrasted with being stuck on a question for hours. In the end I managed to get help on Discord.

### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?

More or less, I did. First I watched Joseph's video, then I did the challenge. I had 3 or 4 questions that I spent on really long time,
like 3 hours for the each one.

# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?

It was good, as I learnt a lot. I paused the video, and copied 90% of the code, until 3 minutes mark, when Joseph deleted everything and started from scratch. Latter, there were some minor changes (maybe 5 to 10) that confused me. I did not try stretch material, as I am still behind timewise.

### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?

That there is so much that I have to learn.
To pay attention to , ; () {} and other 'small' things when writing the code.
