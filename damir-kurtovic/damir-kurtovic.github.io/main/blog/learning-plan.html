          What is your long term goal or career pathway?
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>I do not have a long term career goal. But I have short and medium goals.
            My short term goal is to complete this course and preferably: 1)work as a freelancer or 2) work remotely.
            The alternative is to get a 'usual/normal' job in a company/agency. 
            Medium term - around 2 year mark, my goal is being self employed - working as a contactor/freelancer.

          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>Three of my greatest strengths, are 1)love of learning, 2)curiosity, 3)appreciation 
            of beauty and excellence. All of them keep me motivated to learn and try new things.</p>
          <p>My main limitations are 1)getting bored/ losing interest in the material I am learning/ work that I am doing.
            and the big one 2) giving-up. Limitations could prevent me from doing/trying things
            or cause me to go in circles by starting and stopping many times.</p>

          committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
