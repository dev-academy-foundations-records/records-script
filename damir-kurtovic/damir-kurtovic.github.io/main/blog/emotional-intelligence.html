    <p>
      Emotional intelligence is commonly defined as the capacity to recognize, understand, use, and manage emotions.</p>

      <h2>Short History of EI</h2>
      <p>The concept of 'emotional intelligence' first appeared in 1950's by A. Maslow, renowned American psychologist. 
      The term itself was created in the 1964 research paper. In 1983 Howard Gardner presented 
      the concept of multiple intelligences. In 1990 Peter Salovey and John Mayer expanded on the idea of emotional intelligence
      They claimed that feelings could help people to be more productive, whereas before it was accepted that emotions were in competition with thinking.
      Author and psychologist Daniel Goleman introduced and popularised the term to the general public.</p>
      <p>
        Wiktionary defines EI as "The ability, capacity, or skill to perceive, assess,
         and manage the emotions of oneself, of others, and of groups."

      </p>
      <h2>Popularization of EI</h2>
      <p>In 1995 Goleman published 'Emotional Intelligence -Why it can matter more than IQ'. The book was on The New York Times Best Seller
      list for a year and a half. In the next 11 years he published 3 additional books :
      'Working with Emotional Intelligence' in 1998,
      'Primal Leadership: Unleashing the Power of Emotional Intelligence', with Richard Boyatzis and Annie McKee in 2001, 
      'Social Intelligence: Beyond IQ, Beyond Emotional Intelligence' in 2006.</p>
      <p>Goleman popularized and changed a bit the idea of EI. </p>
