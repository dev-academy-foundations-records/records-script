          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

            <p>Long time ago, my brother and I bought our first car, a second hand Toyota Corolla hatchback.
            While we were living together both of us drove the car and shared its costs.
            Later my brother left Auckland,leaving the car to me. </p>
            <p>I didn't maintain it properly, spending only on petrol.
            The time for renewing WOF arrived, but the engine was leaking oil. 
            Our neighbour suggested that I took the car to his car mechanic friend, and that I would
            get the new WOF, even though the oil was leaking and the engine was really noisy. </p>
            <p>I was tempted to do that, as I would save money.
            After a couple of days, after thinking it through, I realised that in addition to being dishonest 
            I would be losing money in the long run.</p>
            <p>My car might deteriorate more and maybe break down completely. I took the car to another mechanic who fixed the engine and replaced the parts related to oil.
            The repair was expensive, at the time over $300, 25% of its price, as we bought it for $1200.
            I felt relieved as I felt that I did the right thing.
            Looking back, I think that I definitly made the right decision.</p>

            Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
            your values and identity.

            <p> I was born in ex Yugoslavia, and lived there until my late teens
              when my parents(and I) moved to NZ. </p>
            <p>I would say that I was shaped by 3 main cultures:
              1) socialist / communist - during primary school occasionally we had to wear red scarfs and blue hats,
              to remind us of values such as modesty, hard work, solidarity, honesty, etc.
              2) traditional(folk) culture with the values of hard work, keeping one's words
              honour, hospitality, collectivism, etc.
              3) contemporary western culture - I was exposed to it even during my life in Yugoslavia
              through American movies, songs, books, etc.</p>
            <p>Now, living in New Zealand, I am additionally accepting its values, 
              such as individuality, privacy, personal responsibility
              equality, pursuit of wealth and success, etc.
              In addition, people around me shaped my values,especially my family.
              To a lesser degree I also was influenced by my tertiary/university education by accepting some of the values of my
              friends and classmates.</p>

          <li>
            Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
            learning journey.
            <br />
            <br />
              <p>I used the survey from www.viacharacter.org to remind myself of my strengths and values.
              According to it, my top 8 strengths are: love of learning, curiosity, love, creativity, humility, 
              bravery, spirituality and appreciation of beauty and excellence.</p>
              <p>Strengths directly connected to learning are love of learning and curiosity.
              I like to learn new things, to expand my knowledge, to have new experiences,
              taking this bootcamp is a part of that. </p>
          </li>   
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
          <li>
            Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
            development. How might these affect your learning journey?
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>My main limitations are not finishing things/giving up 2) (poor/bad) time management and 
            3) easily getting bored - this overlaps with 1) giving-up as it kind of contributes to it. 
            The mild damage would be procrastination, 
            taking a lot of time to complete tasks. The ultimate damage of the limitations to me would be time wasting - 
            I would start and stop different things/courses and ending nowhere / at the start, but with spend/wasted time.</p>

          <br />
        <li>
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
          <br />
          <br />          
          <p>My example is working on the group project/assignment for the 3rd year management course 
            that I took as a part of my business degree. The aim of the course was to make a prototype of a commercially 
            successful product. Our group of 4 decided to work on a sports umbrella. </p>
            <p>We were supposed to meet outside the class, plan, and decide what to do. 
            My task was to visit different shops and survey what kind of umbrellas were selling. </p>
            <p>I did not believe that we could create a product. I avoided group meetings, did not do given tasks 
            and eventually dropped out - deleted the course. Additional issue was that one of the members was taking this course 
             as a stepping stone for her postgraduate study. She was overly zealous to do well, 
             and was putting the pressure on the rest of us. </p>
             <p>What would I do differently? 1) believe in myself , 2) complete given tasks 3) attend group meetings. </p>
