# Final Reflections - Sprint Four 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

They were great exercises, but too difficult for me, and I don't feel confident with this type of coding

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?

to be honest I felt I'm very weak.

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?

almost all specially, fizzbuzz and gradebook were very difficult. 

### How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?
this week I had to work faster because of power outage on last week.
but I hope to have more time on next week.



### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say? 
        "hard days are coming" :)
