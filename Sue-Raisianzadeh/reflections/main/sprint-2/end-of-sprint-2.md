# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?
The most important thing is to manage my time well and I have made some progress. I also learned a lot of new and very useful things that give me more confidence to program.

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?
working with more developer tools was very useful and helped me feel capable


### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?
working with more developer tools, and building resposive pages


### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?

On this sprint is better than already, as I learned to manage my time better. I hope to finish soon

### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?
I would say that in order to build a web page you need to know several languages that are used to talk to computers. that tells the computer hey, put a picture here.. a paragraph there, a list on the other side and... There are a few languages that you can use to create structures for web pages and another one for how to lay it out. which is full of fun and very interesting,
