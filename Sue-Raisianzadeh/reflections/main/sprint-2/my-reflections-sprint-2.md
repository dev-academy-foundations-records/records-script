# My Reflections - Sprint Two

# Your Blog 

### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?
I watched the Sprint 2 Tech Workshop video and then built my blog based on it in Visual Studio (I opened visual studio by using "code" command on command prompt). I used visual studio terminal for staging and pushing. For staging, after adding a new file and writing code in it, I used "git add ." command and then "git commit -m """ to leave a comment so I can find it later on GitHub. and then "git push"
## How are you finding working with the timeboxes?

I could manage my time better and it makes me more happy, ashelp me to organise my life  

# Learn HTML and CSS 

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?
At CodeCamp, the Responsive Web Design Challenges were very interesting and kind of new to me, and I had to use the "Hint" to solve most of it :)
But sometimes it was very strange, because I couldn't find any difference between what I wrote and what was written on the "hint" page, but the site didn't accept it as a good answer and I had to copy the answer: )
But it was absolutely a very useful exercise

### What are of you proud of from this challenge?
organising my tim, increasing my information by practicing on the Responsive Web Design Challenges and building a web page

# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?
There was so much to know, I didn't know about other types of console commands. The only thing I knew was consol.log(), but now I learned with consol.error..time...group...warn...dir... which was very interesting to me. I always wanted to know how to work with developer tools, and now I found out how to use it to find errors and solve them 


### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?
There are always some blocks in programming, and solving them is an awful part of programming, especially when you spend hours working on it to find the error. But the good thing is that there is always a solution, or there are good friends who help in finding and solving the problem
 

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
17 sheets :) I tried to open the pages I need because I think it helps me to work more easily and it relaxes me :) With those sheets I think I relieve stress

### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.
yes, I did. was very funny.  


# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  
html and css are used for building web pages.ccs provide layotut for a page and help us to build an attractive web pages and html is used for providing the structure for web pages. but it's needed to introduce css to html, then they can do very well. for introducing css to html, is nneded to put csspage's link on "head" in html. you should give the address of cssp page to html, then html can know css and work together friendly to build a nice and attractive web page      

### Any moments of surprise or joy? 
 I was using the "grid" for part of the page, but it didn't work, while it was working on another part of the page, I checked my css and html, and they were all good, but still didn't work, then I used more developer tools and found something strange... it said the position is inline, so it doesn't work. I didn't write any inline positions, but I thought that might be the default setting. Then I put other part of the code on the comment state using the Ctrl & / buttons, then I changed the "grid" to "flex" and suddenly it worked properly and made me very happy as I've been messing with it for a long time.

### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?
so funny question :)... I feel that html is like a cute and furry and lovely animal like a dog.  .  css is like a small animal, like a mouse.  But JavaScript is like a serious and tough man and may be considered similar to a buffalog :)
