# Final Reflections - Sprint Five 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:


### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?

all part made me feel good, I like know more to increase my confidence

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?

when I can not solve issues

### Was Foundations what you expected it to be like? If not, what was different?
they were good. the only thing was they were a lot, and they take a lot of time to do



### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?

When I feel that all the students are ahead of me and I'm behind, I get stressed, and I feel bad that I can't succeed.  But I will continue.

### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?

I prepare myself. I think it's a good opportunity to learn better, but I'm kind of stressed because it's a new experience for me.
I get stressed easily :)


### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?

I think it says: This was the big push to build your future and now you're ready to get a tech job. let's try

### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?
not really, may be it's because I wasn't working properly, or I was not good on coding
