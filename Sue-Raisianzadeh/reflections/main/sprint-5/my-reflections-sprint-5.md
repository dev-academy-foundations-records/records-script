# My Reflections - Sprint Five 


# Tic-Tac-Toe

### What was the most challenging part of this exercise for you?

It was so difficalt for me. I didn't know how should have 2 different player and still I couln't change the subtitle for showing "game over" on the game 

### What learning(s) are you going to takeaway from this exercise?

it was a good exercise to get more familiar with js...about how to use "for" loop and how to use object and dom

# Pair Programming

### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming? yes, we did.  We worked on one of the kata questions and talked about tic-tac-toe while sharing our monitors. I think it's more effective to work on a code with someone else. The only problem was that we didn't know enough about coding. :)




### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during Bootcamp? Why so?
 I think it would be a good way to find the right code

I found 2 different ways for putting the sound.

I did uncorn and mack e mole so far. and unicorn both were good exersises to get familiar with dom and loops
