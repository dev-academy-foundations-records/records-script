# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness 

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

I try to focus on the present, but many times my mind is occupied by various thoughts about past or new news. Today, there is a lot of news about my country, Iran, and it keeps my mind very busy. I try to make time to check the news and then focus on my course

### How did you find the overall experience? 

I think It was not bad and I had some achievement. I can follow time table mostly, but sometimes it's not enough for me

### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness?

 I installed UCLA mindful app and try to meditate every day   

# Listening and Looping 

### What was it like to be fully listened to? 

It was very interesting, It helps to have strong communication and undrestand my job and my coleagues much better

### What was it like to fully listen?

It's like living in the moment among people
    

# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?

I read and paid attention to everything written in the sprint and did all the exercises with research

### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?
I tried, and It was better than previous.

I like to understand them thoroughly so that I can remember them later when programming

# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?

I think that was good for getting to know js and  the use of function and Dom. but I need much more practice 

### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?

I learned about "Dom" and conditions and loop better, but I think It needs more practice to learn it properly.
