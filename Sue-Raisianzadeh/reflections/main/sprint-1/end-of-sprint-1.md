# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?
Paying attention to every detail and checking everything before pushing.
It was good and I pushed them, but sometimes something went wrong and I had to edit and stage and push again.


### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I think my efforts have been useful and I have been able to finish Sprint 1 successfully..:)  I hope so :)
### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?
Working with branch and fork, as they are new for me, and I enjoy learning new things 

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
Some information was duplicated in sprint1
But in general, everything was good

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

Yes, very much ... it used to blame me that you are behind everyone and there is not much time left
