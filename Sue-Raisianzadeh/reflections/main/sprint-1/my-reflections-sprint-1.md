# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
-	Command line is a space that we can enter commands for the computer to process.
-	I think Power shell and Ubuntu and Git Bash are good analogies for Command line.

### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
I think timebox is very good and useful for organizing my time and I tried to use it. But unfortunately I could not stick on the time box. I find it very hard to follow a time box and focus on something for a long time. I can't concentrate especially when reading for a long time.
- But for coding, I can work on data for hours, without feeling tired, because of my great interest in programming. The reason I came to this course was that I want to improve my coding skills because I learned mostly by self-study and I am not good at coding. And I hope I can find a good job.
I'll try to stick to the timebox next time I put my phone away from where I'm studying. I google to find more ways to focus more



### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1. mkdir  make a directory
2. cd   choose directory
3. cat  content of a directory
4. git clone  to clone a reposirory from GitHub
5. git push  sending to a reposiry in GitHub


### Did you learn anything unexpected?

 There was nothing unexpected, but, I didn't know how to create a branch in a repository and how to work with it. Also working with forks was new to me and now I'm glad to get to know them

# Version Control with Git 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a command and GitHub is an internet hosting that offers a cloud based Git repository hosting service. Git offers a lot in how users manage changes. 
We cannot use GitHub without using Git. It is a tool that is used to organize multiple versions of source code, edited then transferred to files and folders in a Git repository. So, GitHub serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository.


### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
When we create a repository on GitHub, we can use git clone to clone it to our hard drive, and after making changes to our files, we can push it to GitHub using git push. We can also use the git branch to create multiple branches on GitHub. It is essential when we work on a project as a team.

### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
I think it needs to practice more to remember well. 
There is a proverb that says: use it, or lose it.
But I think this reflection is a good help to remember.

### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

Unfortunately not, but I was a little better than before. Because I thought that if you ask again, I will be embarrassed that I am still the same as before :)

# Install and Explore Git

### What is a Git workflow?
Git workflow is a recipe or recommendation for how to use git to process work in a stable and productive way. Git workflows encourage developers and DevOps teams to power Git effectively and consistently.
Gitflow is a legacy Git workflow that about Git branching strategies and models, and involves the use of feature branches and multiple primary branches.

### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
I enjoy learning new things and improving my skills
I'm trying my best to figure it out with google and internet searches.
I ask my friends, if my research is not successful. 
Honestly, it's not easy for me to get help because I don't want to bother others


### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
I'm just trying to google more to get a deep dive
And if I find a useful course, I will register

# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?
Staging means adding files, folders, modified and untracked files to a repository. We can do this using (git add . ) and then (git commit –m “”) on the command line. Then we use Git commit as putting a text as a snapshot of our work so that we can find and use it whenever we need it.
# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?
Main is the default and initial branch in Git repositories, when you clone the repository, unless you specify a different branch.
 The default branch in a repository is the base branch for new pull requests and code commits

### Why create a Branch?
We need to use the branch, when we work on a project in a team, so that several people can work on the same project using the branches, then we can merge all the branches that have the same object.    

### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?  
It was not difficult for me, because I knew most of them. But working with branches and forks was new for me

# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?
Forks are often used to repeat ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository.
You can use forks to propose changes related to fixing a bug. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you have found, 
You can Fork the repository, Make the fix and submit a pull request to the project owner.
It an ideal workflow for open source projects
This allows the maintainer to accept commits from any developer without giving them write access to the official codebase.

### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?
Yes, sometimes, when I'm successful in my work or after solving a problem, especially when I've been at it for a long time.

# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?
I didn't feel hopeless, just scared of being late for my homework, feeling like I was behind others.

### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

I knew how to make a website, but it's always interesting to me. I think of it as an art form and I love the arts

# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?
It depends on the problem
I'll remove it and do it again if it's about launching software.
For code: I try to check everything, such as commas, semicolons, and word spelling.
I'm looking for a problem part by part, if it hasn't been solved yet

# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 
It was a good experience, and I hope we all continue to have a good time while working hard to complete this course

### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 
Yes, I was a little bit nervous, but mostly because I wasn't sure what information about my life to share that would fit the questions.
But at the end of the session I felt more comfortable with the group
