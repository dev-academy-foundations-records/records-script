# Final Reflections - Sprint Four 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
  Feeling good, the repitition is helping undrstand the syntax and the repetitive steps for certain problems


### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?
    Becuase I finshed the sprint early I decided to update my blog with some JS. Everytime I make a new post becuase of my design I need to add links to the blog on my home page and at the bottom of the blogs themselves so I automated this process using an array of objects. So now when I make a new blog page I just update the array in one place and wallah it's everywhere it needs to be on the page. I can also change to order from the objects aswell making the newer blogs feature on the home page by changeing one boolean which is super fast and handy.


### Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?
  Getting stuck on simple challenges, I go into more detail on my blog but being stuck on the Bee challenge for a while definitly made me feel un-smart


### How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?
  I am still using the 25 mins on 5 mins off and taking extra breaks for meals and such so that is helping not burnout of get to tired throughout the day.
  Because I finished early I decided to do a few extra challenges thorugh out the week but not spend the sme amout of time studying, I took more time off in the day to be social and see a few freinds and family I haven't caught uo with recently. 


### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say? 
  Going to Dev was the right decition, just remember, put in the effort and the rewards of that will come later
