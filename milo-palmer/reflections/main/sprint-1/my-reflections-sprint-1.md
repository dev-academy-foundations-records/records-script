# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
The command line is a users way of communicating to a computer without a graphic interface. It is a text view of all the files and folders in a computer which a user can interact with using sopecific commands, Using a command line or terminal is similar to driving automatic vs manual a gui is like an automatic easier to understand, but the terminal is a manual there is a bit more complexity but the user has much more control. 


### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
Not exactly I have had some experience with the terminal before so a lot of the commands I'm comfortable with already


### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1.  cd change directory go into filess
2.  mkdir make directory create a folder
3.  touch make a file
4.  pwd prints to the terminal your current directory
5.  rm / rm -rf deletes files and with the -rf tag can be uses to delete folders as well


### Did you learn anything unexpected?

I haven't heard of a shell before so its nice to understand some of what zsh is doing 


# Version Control with Git 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?
- Git is the Version control system that keeps track of the sources and history of the files

- Github is the remote hosting service that lets you clone and store your repos GitHub is a tool to help with Git


### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
Git is like a word document whereas Github is the google drive that stores all the word documents and lets people view older changes and make changes themselves


### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
I imagine we will be using this a fair amount so ideally yes, a quick google will jog my memory if needed


### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
Went a bit over on the time box was enjoying reading stuff and watched a few extra videos


# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a Git workflow?
The process to commit changes to git eg. 
- git status will show us our changed files and new files 
- git add will add those files and folders from the working directory to the staging index
- git commit will take files form the staging index and save them in the repo
- git diff shows changes between versions of a file even without doing a commit


### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
Did a quick google the .gitignore was a bit confusing and them figured out how to see hidden files and open them was only stuck for a short time was sure I could find the solution after a quick search I do enjoy finding video tutorials I need to get better at following text only documentation 


### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
Nope that felt comfortable following a good 30 min on 5 min break if keeping my focus up will continue doing that 


# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?
Its like we play a game of chess and we saved the position of every piece after every move, we have staged each piece on the board the 'computer'/ where we store the portions of the pieces knows what to track and the commit would be each move, we can at any time in the game go back to any point of the game and start again from any place that we commit/wrote down the positions of the pieces


# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?
Main is the master branch it has all the code or files that are complete and have been checked over already. Main is a secure file that shouldn't be touched people can clone or fork from the main and then once files are complete they will be accepted into main.


### Why create a Branch?
If we were to implement new features or bugs we can work on an exact copy of the project without affecting the original means that the original won't be changed and makes collaboration easy as when the branches get merged Git and the users can double check that everything will run smoothly "Theoretically"


### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?  
Feels intuitive command workflow make senses and using branches to implement changes is a intelligent way to approach working on projects and collaboration 


# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?
If you wanted to  add a feature to a repo you dont have permissions on you would fork, from there you could branch and add things as wanted once finished you can send a pull request back to the original source and hope they like your new ideas and accept


### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?
The terminology push and pull, I've worked with devs before and always got comfused who was doing waht when they would ask each other to accpet pull requests or push but know its clicked and lokoing back I understand more of waht was happening 


# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?
Feeling realsonbly confortable on this one have some experience with html so all good so far


### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?
Makes sense computers basicaly just read files html is just another way to communicate what the computer needs




# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?
Breaking problems into smaller probelms achieve one goal of a problem at a time,
Specific to programming usng things like psuedo code can help break probelms apart and look at what should be achived using english 




# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 
Difficult trying to make it short but also wanting to go into depth more, Also communication in text form I feel is not an ideal way to present these things, Not saying make it a video assinment for future cohorts, But you never know how other poeple will read and interpret your thoughts in written form. 


### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 
Yea definitely although I was not first which helped seeing that other pople were doing it and that everyone was putting in a lot of effort so there is a level of empathy and respect form everyone as we all have to spill ourselves onto the page
