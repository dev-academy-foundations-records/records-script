# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?
Sticking to a schedule I've allocated time to be studying and other time to relax or do some more if im feeling like it. Also the 25 min on 5 min off keeps me focused I dont get bored or burnt out doing so. Problems I faced were in core the self evaluation was being procrastinated a bit 


### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
Pretty confident I can pull and push to git easily nothing to complicated this week 


### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?
Ko Wai Ko stood out for me I like when we have been looking at material and then there is a assignment or chalenge that requires you to put it all together, also in those situtions trying to do it without to much assistance helps solidify the concept


### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
Core, Interpreting questions and finding examples was difficult 


### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
Yea, I always feel like I could study longer or work more even if I have achieved what I planned to do that day the voice always insits I can do more or that im lazy for relaxing in the evening. I don't always beleive what it says but I can't say im immune to thinking it isn't right
