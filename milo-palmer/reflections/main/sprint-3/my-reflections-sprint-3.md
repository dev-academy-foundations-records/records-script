# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness 

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?
  I would say about 2 months prior I would've laughed but I read a meditaion book as it helped me fall asleep, I found it boring but it quickly stopped working as it started to get interesting. I still have my doubts about all the claims in the book but seeing UCLA reinforce some of those has made a difference. This wasn't the first time I have meditated and it doesn't seem like the last. 


### How did you find the overall experience? 
  Relaxing and sometimes quite beautiful, It is a sense of peace I don't think can be found anywhere else.


### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness? 
  First thing in the morning works best as we are already in a relaxed state its quite easy to get into a mindfull state. As you guys stated I will start doing it before my dev day begins.




# Listening and Looping 

### What was it like to be fully listened to? 
  Kinda scary but also very nice, respect or connected are words I would use. Having no one respond feels like a one way conversation for 2 minutes also talking to a laptop doesn't help with that. But once it was repeated back it was impressive how much they remembered 


### What was it like to fully listen?
Knowing you can't speak when someone else is talking changes things a lot I really wanted to hear what they said and was also trying very hard to hear everything, every detial knowing I needed to repeat it back. When repeating it back I summarised but had the main points. 
    


# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?
  Doing things myself helps me understand comcepts, I built the subway counter in scriba (Link was in the Handbook), attempting things with the knowledge I have before the answer is given helps show what I understadn and what I don't. This also means when the asnwer way presented I would go back and try agian with out copying to make sure it sticks and I repeat till it does. 


### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?
  Yep I kept in the time brackets for the challenges but spent a bit more time going over the extra reading and videos in the links at the bottom.  





# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?
  I liked the code along I tried at points to pause and do waht he explained was the goal before he did it sometimes doing it sometimes failing. It's surprising how much goes into what seems like a fairly simple programme. The DOM and JS seem to keep making more and more sense the more I do so this did keep taht going. The strech content was a good challenge aswell. 


### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?
Because I have been practising JS on my own prior to getting into Dev I already had a understadning of the syntax and all the conditionals and loops and such but I have been able to achive so much more with the same techniques this week than ever before I often thought I needed to learn more JS to make apps like this but using the same getElementID and returing a new class or innerHTML can achive so much so its good to see that my probelm solving skills and uunderstanding of the basics is getting me so far.
