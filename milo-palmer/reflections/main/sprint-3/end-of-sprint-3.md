# Final Reflections - Sprint Three 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
Pretty good I didn't find anything impossible of out of reach. The most difficult thing is learning to translate a task into how that looks in JS even just is pseudo code


### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?
  Scriba had challenges that we're completely solo HTML CSS and JS doing those following a Figma and having the JS work as intended was super good being able to combine all three and be happy with the outcome is a huge step for me so that was great


### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?
  No part made me angry there is definitely a bit of fustration when it comes to small errors when its something major its easier to find that an unexpected error which is usually spelling or syntax which can be a little tedious.


### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?
  Zero times. If anything this was a good week having done this level of JS before I wanted to try and do a bit of teaching so spent time listening out for the discord JS is hard to grasp at early stages and I really didn't want anyone to feel like giving up, especially in my home group, if they can get a grasp of these concepts fast I think it will make thee journey much more enjoyable and achievable in their minds
