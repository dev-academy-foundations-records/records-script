# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?
I like to replicate, if I do the actions in the video alongside them I retain information better, I like to understand things fully which is a negative in this sense once he started going into JS I was intrigued to understand what was going on at points with that but had to say to myself to just let it go, JS is a next week thing. Limitations would be the understanding of the JS with things like cookies and how local storage works and such.

# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  
  I feel like HTML was built by the engineers or our time focusing mainly on functionality its gets the job done and the content is there but CSS was built by the artists the ones who could see there was more to the internet than grey buttons and the world of CSS elements began websites started looking good on the eyes and some that was their only purpose. The world of animation and creativity breathed life into web design reaching the dark and minimilist sites you get today. 


### Any moments of surprise or joy? 
  Lots of surpise things don't always work as they are expected and the joy comes once those stubborn problems are delt with 


### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?
HTML is a horse it has the basic anatomy and is realistic looking and very functional as a form of travel. CSS is a unicorn it used the basic anatomy and functinality of a horse but has a sense of funk and style that the regualr horse cannot it is focused on looking fantastic before it kills with the horn which is poition fixed in your head from now on.
