# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?
Very Confident although having learnt HTML and CSS before it is something I need to keep practising or I forget how it functuons and the syntax although it has come back very fast this time so hopefully that gets better and better


### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?
Adding my media queries feel like I had control over how my site functioned at every level I haven't changed grid's to flexboxs and such using @media so that felt great


### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?
Core will continue to be the difficult part so at this stage it is important to keep at it. Its a good level of anxiety the level which you learn at 


### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?
I had a very productive week so the voice was happy with what I accomplished, I was quite strict on myself with times to be working which was tough but felt increadibly fulfilling. Jared also said its important to have down time so you can function well and be productive (I imagine you will read this so thanks for that advise)


### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?
  It takes two things. First a file containing the content of the website in a programming language called HTML. This contains all the text you want people to read and the images they will see. You have a website at this point that is all it really but we want a bit more than just text on a page. Secondly we have a file which will make it look pretty this file contains a langauge call CSS it stand for cascading style sheet this we will write a list of all the things we have on our HTML file and give them things like colours, sizes, positions waht the mouse cursor does when it interacts. Once all that is done we have a website. It is just files that the browser converts to a website.
