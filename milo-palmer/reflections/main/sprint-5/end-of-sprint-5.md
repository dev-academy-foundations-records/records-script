# Final Reflections - Sprint Five 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:


### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?
  Sprint 3 Scrimba challenges the self run tasks doing HTML,CSS and JavaScript all connected and without guidence was good fun. Figuring out your own solution to the challenges was fun following designs CSS wise and the actual logic of the script


### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?
  JS-Kata certian simple challenges took me ages to figure out that made me feel a bt stupid but hoefully more prctise will reduce sill mistakes and simple problem solving skills will get better


### Was Foundations what you expected it to be like? If not, what was different?
  Yes, Having done a bit of HTML,CSS and JS before I didnt feel overwhelmed and was able to achive alot more with the same syntax knowledge which was rewarding  



### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?
  Zero, Keep for bootcamp and looking into REACT



### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?
  Got a few areas I want to work on but feeling ready got a week to get myself caught up in the areas I want and to have a little R&R



### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?
    You are very stoked of the effort that was put in. Making sacrifices and doing your best will be worth it



### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?
  No, doesn't feel hackerman enough. I wan't to solve some very complicated probelms and build some cool apps or sites once I have a few projects to my name I will be starting to feel like one
