# My Reflections - Sprint Five 


# Tic-Tac-Toe

### What was the most challenging part of this exercise for you?
  Figuring out how to stop the game once someone has won, and making sure my code is efficient using funcitons and not repeating where unnecessary


### What learning(s) are you going to takeaway from this exercise?
    Using functions to render out the page elements when changes are make and learing how to use the HTML audio with JS to ake sounds play


# Pair Programming

### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?
    Not exaclty pair programming but having worked as a Webflow Dev before and being in a learner role / intern there was lots of wokring out issues with devs and talking to them about my ideas to solve problems and best practises that was super helpful and taught me a lot



### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during Bootcamp? Why so?
  Yea leaning to be a good navigator will be difficult for me, I don't want to be the person to take over or take away from my peers learning so there is room to be aware of myself and working on that skill



# Inflate the Unicorn

### Did you learn anything new during this exercise? What was it?
    How to use event.target and use the same fucntion to effect muliple elemtents



### Did you encounter issues completing any of the steps of this exercise? How did you resolve this?
    Understanding how the challenge was to be completed at first was a bit confusing but having the ReadMe to work with helped show how to break it down into smaller problems and the steps needed 



### If you were to replace the unicorn with another mystical animal of your choice, what would it be?
    Dragon, have it breath fire 



# Whack-a-mole

### What was the hardest part of this exercise?
    Same as the unicorn,Understanding how the challenge was to be completed at first but once I understood how to view the cells and make them an array how to manipuate that and view it as just an array and now an HTML element helped break it down



### Can you think of any different ways you could have accomplished the same outcome?
    No, something to look at for next week



# Dress the Clown

### How did you find the process of refactoring your code?
  It was a great way to break down the problem and use that as an understanding of how the next steps should be acheived 



### Would you do anything differently if you were to start this challenge again?
     Not sure, something to look at for next week again for strech



### What piece of code are you proudest of from this exercise?
    There wasn't any good use of syntax to solve probelms but learing how to use keypress event listeners was a highlight opens up lots of project ideas



# JS Carnival

### What parts of these challenges did you enjoy? If we were to add more challenges, what would you like to have more of?
    Having the ReadMe as a guide to how to look at problems from a progamme point of view achiveing certain tasks that build toward the bigger picture. Not sure if more challenges are needed but if so maybe more keypress events 



### What parts weren't so good? Were there any parts that you felt stuck on?
    No, all had enough of a challenge to be doable but also teachable moments and good practise to repeat the JS things from sprint 3



### Which parts made you feel confident?
    Whenever a challenge was completed was a good burst of energy felt good to know its all something that can be done and figured out



### What personally would you want changed to improve the carnival?
    Not sure, More clown type outfits for the so called clowns
