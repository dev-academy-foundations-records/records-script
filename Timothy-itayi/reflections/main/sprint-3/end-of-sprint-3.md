# Final Reflections - Sprint Three 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I would say i am pretty confident. I do think i need some time to get my head around loops and the like. sprint -3 was a lot to digest. However i do think i have had some time to think about how to manage my time more productively through out sprint-2 and 3. 

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?
My favourite part of the sprint was the lecture. Having a human face in a video lecture ( i wish it was live but pre recorded does make things a lot easier just want more of them though :))

### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?

The parts that annoyed me the most was the research portion. Basically everything that didnt invovle another person. Foundations suck without human interaction. I am feeling alone each waking sprint. I can't wait for it to be over so i can be around other people. Mainly so we can get frustrated together. 



### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?

I'll be honest, giving up isnt really an option . I did however just take time away from the computer and just do something else that wasnt related to the work. 
I have discovered if i dont lift weights each day atleast once i wont be a very happy camper. Sitting down and coding for X amount of hours at a time is fun and all but i miss the rage and have to have an outlet for my frustration when the code is coding like it should.
