# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness 

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

I can't help but have a bias towards mindfulness, it really helps you sort through your mind. Meditation especially is the key to being mindful. Being aware of your emotions and understanding how you are feeling is so important especailly in a high pressure environment. I have found mindfulness to be the essential source of freedom for the soul. 

### How did you find the overall experience? 

I have found the experience mainly the gudided meditation honestly to be a little toooff putting for my liking. I have been medatating for over 3 years now. Applying the Wim Hof breathing technique especailly before a heavy lift session or just when I start to feel anxious or depressed (mainly when my code doesn't code and i don't know why or when my code works and i don't know why.) 


### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness? 
    
My daily habit of commitment is atleast once a day followed by a session of movement. (lifting or walking)This varies from either the morning before a code sesssion or in the afternoon after a code stint. After sprint -2 i have decided to implement blocks at which i code for a period of 2-4 hours. This is similar to when race car drivers compete in a endurance race, they are usually in groups of 4 and each driver is allocated a stint (amount of time to drive during the race). For example the most famous endurance race is called the 24HR of LE MANS. The drivers of this race divide the 24hrs into 6 hour stints each.(however these stints may vary depending on what happens on track i.e: a crash resulting in a safety car or a red flag which restarts the race. )



# Listening and Looping 

### What was it like to be fully listened to? 
It wasn't that different to being listened to when i am having a chat with my friends or family. 
Honestly felt normal. I guess i am used to it. I do like being listened to but its even nicer to have someone relay what you just said or atleast get the jist of it. 


### What was it like to fully listen?

    To fully listen to me is to actively take part in someone else's world. You are encapsulated by them and what they say and if they are heavliy invested in what they say and aren't to shy its easy to listen.  




# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?

i noticed that i have to be more patient with myself a lot more when it came to learning JavaScript.
What worked for me was reading through the questions and videos and just taking the time to slowly let the information sink in. If i wasnt sure about that something i simply googled it. Otherwise i would try and figure it out

### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?

I tried to keep within the boxes. However sometimes it took me a while to getm head around some problems. Honestly the hard part was getting to a challenge that i thought was easy enough actually became a little too frustrating and i realised i needed to get out my own way and go back to basics a lot more. 




# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?

I found it very soothing to code along the lecture. It helped me better understand what i was doing and how everything worked. I would like to have more lectures in the future hopefully. Its nice to have someone code in front of you so you have a much better idea of how things are working more fluidly. 

### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?

I learned that even the tiniest of successes (i.e the code working as it should or just laying out the code in the proper way) really does make a difference in my mood when i was following along. Unfortuantely i was in a bit of a snag with the code. Everything was working fine until it wasnt. i did ask for help but by the time i go a response and with no solution in sight i had to move on to the blog. I will try and get back to it, but judging from the amount of content in sprint-3, I dont think i will have the time. But god willing i suppose.
