# Final Reflections - Sprint Five 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:


### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?

The meetings we had with each other as a group. I found those to be my favorite part of foundations. 
Mainly due to the fact that we got to find out how people were feeling about the challenges presented.

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?

The coding. Not saying I dont like it. I just found it hard to grasp the concepts and functions of the bigger picture. My main problem was that I could'nt put all the things I learnt into one big stack of code. I found 
myself lost in a sea of fear becaue I could'nt understand it. ALso Online learning after a while get soooooo
boring. I really missed having workshops and demos done by facilitators in my weekly meetings because they
were really informative but also not at the same time. I wish we had more live demos. 

### Was Foundations what you expected it to be like? If not, what was different?
Yes! it was exactly as expected. A tough lonely road. With a splash of success and failure. 



### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?
Honestly I never felt like giving up but what did keep me going was my detemination to try and understand
the logic, iteration, structure and expressions of the problems put infront of me. 


### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?

I still feel unprepared and will probably take some time to study and revise on the concepts that made me feel uneasy to begin with. It really was a lot of information to deal with and I really want to try my best and make sure I understand how thing work more effectively.


### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?

Don't give up. Practice. Practice. Practice.


### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?

yes I do. I know how to make an html file, I know how to make a css file and I know some JavaScript. How 
could I not say I am a programmer.
