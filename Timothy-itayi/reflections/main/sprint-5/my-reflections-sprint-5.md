# My Reflections - Sprint Five 


# Tic-Tac-Toe

### What was the most challenging part of this exercise for you?

The most challenging aspect for this exercise was trying not to fall on my face with the planning stages.
I thing psuedocode especially was the main challenge. Breaking everything down to what is it we are trying to achieve followed by how to go about making the necessary adjustments and applying the right methods to 
what we want. When I say it like this its sounds ridiculous....

### What learning(s) are you going to takeaway from this exercise?
To use psuedcode to better plan my way through a challenge. 
Learnt to always go back on the bookmarked resources provided from previouse sprints. 
Learnt to ask for help from my fellow students and googled anything i may have forgotten about. 
learnt to take risks and just try something and see if it works. 
Learnt to think outside the box and allow myself to be okay with failing and feeling frustrated. 



# Pair Programming

### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?

NO. my initial reaction was yes! I actually enjoyed code pairing. It felt refreshing to be with someone and 
just have them explain how their code works to me and vice versa. 


### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during Bootcamp? Why so?
No i think it will be very beneficial for me to work with others. I want to be able to work with others and to be able to better understand notj ust how another person works but also how to work as a team. I personally enjoy having another person to work with especially for programming. 



# Inflate the Unicorn

### Did you learn anything new during this exercise? What was it?
I learnt that structuring expressions in the right way makes a huge difference.
What I mean is that when we were given teh assignment of making our own variations of JavaScript code,
I didnt realise how important it was to apply a formula to my code so it was readable. 
With some quick google checks on where to begin with firstly figuring out how to call a function, 
I found it easier after that. 



### Did you encounter issues completing any of the steps of this exercise? How did you resolve this?

Fuck Yes!!!! 
okay I was ill for a few days and couldn't be infront of a computer for longe than 5mins so I eneed up not coding for over 3 days! Not ideal in the slightest , so my main issue I found was that I coudln't remember 
the syntax of the expressions that I needed to apply or implement for the code to work... 
I found myself lost in a sea of despair and hopeless because  I could not figure out a way to start, 
okay I did know how to start I just didnt know what to write...
(side note Coding everyday is a must from now on...even if sick I dont't care its my body...)


### If you were to replace the unicorn with another mystical animal of your choice, what would it be?

I would definitely like to replace the Unicorn with a bull frog or something where an animale actually inflates. 


# Whack-a-mole

### What was the hardest part of this exercise?




### Can you think of any different ways you could have accomplished the same outcome?




# Dress the Clown

### How did you find the process of refactoring your code?

I found that quite daunting at first because I was following along to Joseph's Workshop for the challenge,
and I quickly got comfortable with the way he was going with the code. However when he decided to refractor 
the code, I found that I could not find a way to understadn what he done Or more so just not quite wrap my
head around how it was working so well with in itself....


### Would you do anything differently if you were to start this challenge again?

Yes I would. For starters I would create and index of indexes for the body parts and define a
variable for them nested inside the function responsible for changing the outfits when a key pressed left or right. Also have a better understanding of the use of functions in a more optimal way.


### What piece of code are you proudest of from this exercise?

I can't be proud of just one. I love all my children. 



# JS Carnival

### What parts of these challenges did you enjoy? If we were to add more challenges, what would you like to have more of?

Honestly the beginning of each challenge. I found that at the very beginning of the challenges it was
a wasteland of hopelessness and dispair but also exciting and interesting having to solve a problem and go back to the basic fundamentals of what we have learnt. Some of the (optional) resources provided in earlier sprints really  helped me for these challenges. I would like to have more variety so Inflate the unicorn was 
good but then have a something that is a lot different to that so its not so similar like dress the clone. 
maybe a build a bear puzzle game where the aim is to get the bear to come together but the images are hidden and need to be turned appropriately in order to make the bear whole again. 




### What parts weren't so good? Were there any parts that you felt stuck on?

I was good at implementing appropriate solutions to the problems. I found my self gazing into the abyss 
when I got stuck on a problem and didn't know which keys to push mainly my knowledge and the properties and functions got the best of me and I failed to remeber how to structure the code well. 


### Which parts made you feel confident?

I felt confident when I was able to solve my own syntax errors or look for the right person to 
help me if needed. I also felt confident when I was able to help another student with their own issue with their code. Made me feel less alone about my own shortcomings.... 


### What personally would you want changed to improve the carnival?

I would prefer to have on challenge be a workshop lecture like the dress the clown. That way I gets students 
who are'nt so inclined with the online portion of the course to feel like its more hands on then have 
us do the rest of the challenges.. Also It would be nice to have more challenges but have them be categoriezd 
as easy, medium and hard. (stretch god mode)
3 challenges each but the hard part is 2 out of the 3 )
