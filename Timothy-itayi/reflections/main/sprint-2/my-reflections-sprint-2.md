# My Reflections - Sprint Two

# Your Blog 

### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?

I copied a template .html file (website file) that would eventually be my blog and linked it with css (Cascading style sheet)so that i could make changes to the template  and pushed it back up to my  remote repo. 

### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?

I tried to but was met with some hurdles. I took a step back and asked for help before i got too frustrated.  



# Learn HTML and CSS 

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?

 Mainly getting my head around the concepts and functions of HTML and CSS
 At the first they were easy to understand but then as i was going through the tutorial i realised how complex things became.
 I quickly overcame the self doubt when i realised i didnt need to memorise anything. It was in my best interest to just try to understand the best i can and look at the hints and videos to know how to type out the code. After that it became a lot easier to manage. :)

### What are you proud of from this challenge?

Being able to adjust to the next challenge without being too hard on myself about not remembering how to do something. I foud that if i read through the instructions and think about what i had just done it would click and it did. (some of the time) :)


# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?

I found it intimidating at first just from watching the tutorial but eventually got my head around some of the basic concepts involving the Console, application and sources tab. As i found those  more interesting due to the fact that you can actually change the web page( also helps to have live.server installed on your code editor) :)

### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?

Not at all to be honest. I followed along without any issues 

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

13 out of  13 tabs are all related to study. Github related tabs are 6, 1 is for the foundation handbook, the rest are coding cheatshets  and\or coding related questions errors that i  just left open  

### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.

Yes i did. just to see if it could work. 


# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  

Okay here we go....
HTML was born Hypertext Markup Language. The content that you see when you are on a website. HTML would be a skeleton and CSS , born Cascading Style Sheet would be the skin. 
I mean theres nothing wrong with being bare bones but i mean its  even better when you have some skin.
On their own that would not be very appealing, like imagine a person who was just bones. Not a lot to grab there but then again imagine a person with just skin.  Might as well be a teddy bear.  

### Any moments of surprise or joy? 

My moment of surprise and joy was witnessing live changes to my blog. Even though its so small and ugly right now, I do think i am on the right path . 

### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?

mmmmmm i guess HTML would be algae and css would be coral. I guess without algae there is no coral and vice versa .
