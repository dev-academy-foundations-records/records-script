# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?

I have garnared a new level of confidence with the amount of work given to me. I would say my confidence level has sky rocketed as a result of the amount of work provided. 

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?

I would say when it was related to coding the website. Once i started to gain more confidence in myself and check in regularly with the rest of my fellow students and post a meme everyday i became more and more capable as the days went through. 


### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?

When it came to coding the blog. Yes i just said how confident i was doing it but when it wasnt working i wanted to throw my computer away and end it all. Also seeing others progress further than me made me feel depressed and unworthy, however i did manage to get myself out of that rabbit hole by taking my time and knowing that everyone goes through foundations at their own pace. 

### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?

Honestly if i wasnt doing something right my voice in my head doesnt say anything. Only when im doing somehting right does it decide to come out of the wood work and express to me how inefficient i am.

### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?

I would say to them. Firstly take a shot of vodka, pray and download vscode, sign up to git hub and watch a tutorial on youtube and apply yourself with FreeCodeCamp. I've only just started to learn how to make one myself and i can only express how i feel about it which is. If you dont mind failing 7 times to get up 8 you are in the right place.
