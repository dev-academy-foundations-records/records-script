# My Reflections - Sprint Four 

# Code Readability

### What makes code more readable for you?

Code is readble for me when the code itself is consice and easy to understand. However it is nice if it is indented.
I am still working on that aspect of my code. 

### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?

I prefer tabs when indenting.

### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?

My work space at the moment is in the lounge. So i do to some degree try to change up my workspace. I am trying to move all my work gear into the office space so that i can have a better work environment. 
To answer your question it is messy at the moment. 



# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    let expected = 7
    let actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```
### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`: 
```
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

### Do you think you would prefer using Test Driven Development? Why?

I would prefer it mainly because i like to pace my self and Test-Driven Development's approach can be beneficial for developers as it helps to ensure the code is working as intended, prevents regressions, and encourages writing modular and well-structured code. TDD can also improve the overall quality and maintainability of a project and increase confidence in making changes to the codebase. However, it requires a certain level of discipline and can slow down the initial development process, so it's a trade-off that developers need to weigh depending on the project requirements and constraints.


# Kata

### How did you find using repl.it in practice? Confusing? Useful?
very confusing. I found that there is a lot of code that is not consistent with the codebase and the documentation  of repl.it itself   should  not be considered   a trade-off. I found it too confusing. 

### Was it helpful to look at the tests while coding the kata?
i found more use using my terminal environment over the browser environment. 

### What problem solving techniques did you implement in your coding flow?
I would read through the documentation of the problem and then test the code. The hints in the error messages gave me an insight on the problem and i was able to identify the problem. My main flaw from this was the Syntax. 

### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?
All of it. I will say again the Syntax is my main issue with solving- problems. I can understand what a function or attribute may or may not do but i can not for the life of me remember how to write the code out. I think the issue with solving Fizzbuzz was that it made me second guess my own ability a lot more.


### Did you want to change and refactor your code once you were finished?

Yes i did. I honestly can't tell you if it is cleaner than the previous code. I am still working on implementing my own style of code, so that others can have a better understanding of the issue and/or be able to find a better solution to the problem that i may have. I am still new to this so all code is clean code to me.
