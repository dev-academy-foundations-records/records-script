# Final Reflections - Sprint Four 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
I ma not too confident with any of them yet. I think I need a little bit more time to wrap my head around them. The course has gone so fast that I have found myself having to back paddle a few times or rather just so I can keep up. 


### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?
some of the kata challenges as well as the JavaScript methods to research made me feel smart I suppose but I didn't really think I was. I'll be honest nothing in this sprint made me feel smart at all. Mostly confused, challenged, hopeful and lastly appreciative, because I realised that it wasn't as important to me to be thinking yes I am so smart. How could I? I dont understand a thing and thats okay I think. 


### Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?

Mainly the  Kata challenges. They were a head twister because I got overwhelmed by the syntax. 

### How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?
I took breaks from the computer and had snacks when I could. However the one thing that helped me was having a conversation with my girlfriend about her parents which helped me understand javascript a lot more. By stepping away from the computer and occupying a space unrelated to the code or programming, I soon discovered that the language i use each and everyday can be translated into JavaScript if you know what to look for.. 


### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say? 
Its okay if you struggle, this sprint is bloddy difficult to understand , take everything with a full stride and dont forget to enjoy yourself each and every step of the way.
