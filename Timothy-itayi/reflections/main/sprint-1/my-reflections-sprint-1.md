# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?

 The command line helps you communicate with your computer through a text based language.

       For Example: The Operating system is the house and the directory is a room in the house, PWD(PRESENT WORKING DIRECTORY) is a command asking you where you are in the house.

      The CD(CHANGE DIRECTORY) is a command going from one room to another.


### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

 I personally found the timebox very helpful in my quest to progess through the phases of the first sprint.
      However i did find myself meandering a bit and had to set a timer on my phone after the first few tutorials. I found it better using my phone than i did setting up so many accounts for the foundations course. Overall a great lesson in managing time and expectations.

### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1. ls = a list of files and/or directories
2. pwd = present working directory
3. mkdir = create directories 
4. rm= delete files or directories 
5. mv = moves files


### Did you learn anything unexpected?

I expected it not to be easy but fun once you get around it.

# Version Control with Git 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?

 Git lets you manage and keep track of your source code whilst GitHub is a service that lets you manage the Git repositories.

### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?

An analogy for this would be GIt is a standalone computer whilest GitHub is a network of computers

### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?

Probably not, this is already quite foriegn to me so having a week off from this and not revising is just asking for trouble.

### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

yes. This time aroudn i amde sure to increse the speed of the tutorials by 2x just so ican better maange my time and start practicing how to use Github.

# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a Git workflow?

Basically offers a team of developers flexibility in how users manage changes to the main branch or default branch, with every change logged in a running history. 


### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

I noticed that i have to be patient with myself and i am more confused than i ever was. 
      I think mainly due to the nature of the foundations course be so isolatiing. 
      I feel like i am behind but i always remind myself that i must take a deep breath and advance one step at a time and not think about how far others may be.

### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?

DO NOT RUSH ANY OF IT. BUT BE VIGILANT AND ASK  GOOGLE OR FACILITATOR!!

# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?

Imagine a box. You can put stuff into the box. You can take stuff out of the box. This box is the staging area of Git. Commit is like sealing that box and putting a label on it.


# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?

The Main or Main branch also known as the Master branch is the default branch in Git/GitHub.

### Why create a Branch?

 You create a branch essentially for the purpose of wanting to add new features/fixes and/or experiment new ideas in a contained area of your repository  without affecting the main branch that your team might be working on.

### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?  

Yes. With the help of the tutorials and revisison practice its not too difficult. 
     Also my time management is a lot better this time around. :) 

# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?

Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project


### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

Yes. I think personally things all clicked when i was able to clone , change , stage , commit and pull my repository for the ko-wai-koe project earlier. With a bit of help from my facilitator Lani the concepts became much more clearer. 

# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?

I have felt frustated at all.


### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

Not really what i pictured but also kinda excepted as much considering how complicated and not so complicated the whole process is. Once you know genreally how the sausage is made it doesn't surprise me in the least what other measures are needed to take place for things to come together. 



# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?

Usually my process goes as follows

1: React with confusion for about 5 min

2: Pull myself together and identify where i went wrong and try and figure out a way to fix it.

3: If the problem is too dificult to find or solve. I simply ask google.

4: If google cant find it, i'll message the group for help.

5: if all else fails expsoe myself to some Grand Torismo sport for 10 min and come back again with fresh eyes :)



# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 

Not difficult at all to be honest. I am in the acting world so being exposed to strangers isnt really that daunting.

### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 

I could'nt feel my ego no. When it comes to something like this an ego is not required. Mostly gets in the way of what is more important, which is having a sense of awareness and not being too hard on yourself.
