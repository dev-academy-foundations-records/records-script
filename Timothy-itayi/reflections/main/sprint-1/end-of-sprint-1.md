# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?

Definitely felt like the time keeping helped me manage my expections and my time working on each problem. However my problems came to light more often when i realised or had missed a step or two and had to ask my facilitator about how to resolve the issue. Only for both of us to realise that what neeeded to happen was to be in the folder in question before setting a command.  

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

After this sprint i have gained so much confidence. Mainly from  the resources provided and dont feel lost about web development anymore. 


### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?

all of it. I love all my children 

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

When things didnt work. Mainly my lack of understanding 

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?


No. I meditate everyday so the little voice in my head never shuts up about flowers and rainbows.
