     <p class="paragraph">
        Emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive, interpret, demonstrate, control, evaluate, and use
        emotions to communicate with and relate to others effectively and constructively.
        This ability to express and control emotions is essential, but so is the ability to understand, interpret, and respond to the emotions 
        of others.

     <h1 class="header">How is EQ different to IQ? & Why is EQ important?</h1>

     <p class="paragraph">
      Emotional intelligence (EQ) and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) are two different measures of human abilities.

      IQ measures a person's cognitive abilities and potential for learning and problem solving, while EQ measures a person's emotional abilities and the capacity to understand and manage emotions in oneself and others. EQ is the ability to identify, understand, and manage one's own emotions, and the emotions of others, and to use that information to guide thoughts and actions.
      
      EQ is considered important for several reasons:
      
      Better relationships: People with high EQ are often able to establish strong and fulfilling relationships with others, as they are able to effectively understand and communicate their own emotions, as well as those of others.
      Improved decision making: EQ allows individuals to manage their own emotions, and to take the emotions of others into account, which can lead to better decision making in personal and professional settings.
      Increased resilience: People with high EQ are often better able to handle stress and adversity, as they have developed strategies for regulating their emotions and coping with difficult situations.
      Improved leadership skills: EQ is important for effective leadership, as it allows leaders to understand the emotions of their employees, communicate effectively, and create a positive work environment.
      In conclusion, EQ and IQ both play important roles in our lives, but EQ is particularly relevant in our personal and professional relationships, and can have a significant impact on our ability to effectively navigate the social and emotional demands of our lives
