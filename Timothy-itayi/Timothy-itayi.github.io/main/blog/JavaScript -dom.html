    <h1>What is a Dom</h1>
    <p>The Dom or 'Document Object model' is a programming API for HTML and XML
        documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a 
        document is accessed and manipulated. In the DOM specification, the term
        "document" is used in the broad sense. The model itself closely resembles 
        the structure of the documents it models. For instance, consider this table,
        taken from an Html document:

        <Table>
            <ROWS>
                <TR>
                    <TD>/Document></TD>
                    <TD>/HTML></TD>
                </TR>
                <TR>
                    <TD>/Head></TD>
                    <TD>/body></TD>
                </TR>
            </ROWS>
        </Table>

         <p class="paragraph">In the document Object Model, documents have a logical structure which is very
        much like a tree; to be more precise , it is like a 'forest' or 'grove' which can 
        contain more than one tree. However , the Document Object Model does not specify 
        that documents be implemented as a tree or a grove, nor does it specify how the 
        relationships among objects be implemented in any way. In other words , the object 
        model specifies the logical model for the programming interface, and this logical 
        may be implemented in any way that a particular iplementation finds convenient.</p>    
        
        



        <h1 class=" How does the DOM relate to CSS and HTML">How does the Dom relate to CSS and HTML?</h1>



       <p class="paragraph" > Using the DOM in CSS in not limited to classes or ids that you create. You can use any element 
          to walk through the document - any HTML tag in fact. Granted it is not quite as advanced as 
          JavaScript in allowing you to move up and down the DOM but it does allow you to quickly 
          target elements on the page. 
           
         Let's say i want to make "My can of beer" bold. I don't actually need to change the document at all.
         Using the DOM tree i can specify a rule that will make the text bold. </p> 
         <img src = "/assets/css + dom example.png" alt="image"> 
         <img src="/assets/getElementById()Method.png" alt="image">
         <p class="paragraph">
             The easiest way to access a single element in the DOM is by its unique ID. You can get 
             an element by ID with the getElementById() method of the document object. 
                    </p>
    <h1 class="sub heading">Events and it's relation to the DOM</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">
      Events are signals fired inside the browser window that notify of changes in the browser or operating system
      environment. Programmers can create event handler code that will run when an event fires, allowing web pages to respond
      appropriately to change. These 'Events' are documented in and/or below the pages for the JavaScript objects that emit them. 
      For example these 'Events' can range from: Animation, Composition, Gestures,Inputs and Media to name a few. :)

     
     

      The addEventListener() method allows you to add event listeners on any HTML DOM object such as HTML elements, HTML document, the window object,
      or other object that support events. </p>
     These are some of the DOM events for HTML➚
      <img src="/assets/event objects relating to the dom.png" alt="image">
     

      <p class="paragraph">DOM Events allow JavaScript to add an event listener or event handlers to HTML elements. 
        The way to set an event handler on an element is to use the EventTarget.addEventListener() Method/
        This approach allows multiple listeners 
       to be assigned to an element, and for listeners to be removed if needed.          
      </p>

    <h1 class="header">HTML DOM FORM SUBMIT METHOD() </h1>

    <p class="paragraph">
        The HTML DOM Form submit() method is used for submitting the form data to the address specified by the action attribute. It acts as 
        a submit button to submit form data and it doesn't take any kind of parameters.
        <img src="/assets/Dom Form submit() method.png" alt="image">
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Example code for the Form Submit() method:
                <img src="/assets/dom method code example.png" alt="image">
                This will produce the output:
                <img src="/assets/Form_submit output.jpeg" alt="image"> 
                <img src="/assets/Form Id.png" alt="image">
                 The Submit button executes the SubmitForm() method on being clicked by the user- 
                 This submits the form data to the address specified by the action attribute-

        <h1>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">

            Let’s imagine that you are in charge of planning the layout of a new neighborhood in the city. 
            This neighborhood will have some residential buildings, some eateries, a bank branch and a mall.
        </p>
               <img src="/assets/java analogy .png" alt="image">

              <p class="paragraph">
                The structure of the building itself.
               The interior and exterior decoration of the building.
                The actual functions that vistiors can perfom in each building.</p>
               <p class="paragraph">
                Each building is just a point on a map, with no nuance. But when you dig a little deeper, you can see that
                each building actually has three parts you can change.                  

                This corresponds to the three different types of files that you can use in your first website.
               </p>
          

         <img src="/assets/dom analogy .png" alt="image">
         <img src="/assets/dom analogy 2.png" alt="image">
         <p class="paragraph">
            Since each of these three languages serves a different purpose, web developers generally use separate files for each one.
            This idea is call "separation of concerns"-each file should have a different function within thesite as a whole.
            Although you could technically include all the code in one HTML file, that will eventually lead to repetitive code 
            as you grow your site.

         <h1 class="heading">What is control flow and loops?</h1>

                  <p class="paragraph">
            Control flow statements let you control the flow of the execution of the code in your program. In JavaScript programming 
            you can control the flow of execution of the code by placing the decision making , branching , looping and adding conditional blocks.
                     </p>
                     <img src="/assets/analogy flow.png" alt="iamge">
                     <p class="paragraph">
                    Once it is determined whether a condition is True or False the program knows what actions to take 
                    and will then continue on to the next condition to repeat the process. A anology to control flow is 
                    a kin to traffic managment.. The determine the order in wich cars are allowed to drive at every moment. 
                 </p>

                     <img src="/assets/control flow.png" alt="image">

    <p class="paragraph">
    Generally we use decision-making statements when we have to decide which block of the code will be executed.
    There are 3 types of decision-making statements.
        </p>
        If statement: 
        <img src="/assets/if statements.png" alt="image">
        <p class="paragraph">
            The if statement is the most basic decision- making statements in the java programming language.
            There are two possible values of the condition , i.e. true and false.
         The code block after the if statement will execute only if the value of the condition statement is true. 
         If the value of the condition statement is false, the code block will not be executed. </p>
       
        <img src="/assets/if statement 2.png" alt="image">

        <p class="paragraph">
          The if else statement is somewhat similar to the if statement, we are just adding an extra block of code 
        after the if statement. If the value of the condtion statement is true, the if block will be executed, else 
    else block will be executed. </p>
    <img src="/assets/switch example.png" alt="image">

    <p class="paragraph">
       The switch statement is used to perfom different actions based on different conditions.
       The way it works is as follows.. The switch expression is evaluated once.
       The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case. 
       If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed. 
       If there is no match , the default code block is executed. 
 </p>
    <h1 class="header">LOOPS WHAT ARE THEY?</h1>

    <p class="paragraph">
       In programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is continully repeated until a certain condition is reached/ 
       Typically, a certain process is done such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked
       such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number.
 </p>
      <img src="/assets/for loops.png" alt="image">
      <p class="paragraph">
        In the for loop, we are going to check the value of the condition statement.
    If the value is true, the block of the code will be executed. 
After the successful execution of the code block, control goes to the condition statement. Now, if the value is true, again
the block of the code will be executed. 
 </p>

 <p class="paragraph">
    A real world example of a loop would be software of the ATM machine.
    The ATM machine is in a loop to process transactions until you acknowledge that you have no more to do. 
    </p>
    <h1 class="header"> The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h1>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Objects for starters are used to represent a "thing" in your code. That could be a person, a car , a building, a book,
        a character in a gam. Basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. In objects,
        these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value.
        There are 3 ways to access data in an object. object.property, object['property'], const{ property}= object.
        <img src="/assets/object.property.png" alt="image">
        <img src="/assets/[].object.png" alt="image">
        <img src="/assets/const{object}.png" alt="image">
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
           An array on the other hand is whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are especailly useful 
           when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position in the list.
       The way you would access data in an array is by referring to its index number. The index arrays starts with [0], meaning the first element has index [0] and the second has [1].  </p>

       <h1 class="header"> What are functions and why are they helpful?</h1>

       <p class="paragraph">
        A Function is simply a "chunk" of code that you can use over and over again, rather than writing it out multiple times.</p> 

        <img src="/assets/function.png" alt="image">
        
       <p class="paragraph"> Functions are helpful because it enables programmers to break down or decompose a problem into smaller chunks, each of which performs a particular task.
    Once a programmer defines a function, they can then call it whenever they need it, simply using its name. However in order to work,
the function will probably require some inputs or parameters, which are given to the function each time it is called.  </p>
