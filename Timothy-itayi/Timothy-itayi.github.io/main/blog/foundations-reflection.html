    <h1 class="heading ">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h1>

      <p class="script"> Through the core exercises, I have gained a valuable insight. It's not just about coding, but also about training the mind to adopt a positive mindset (growth-oriented).
         I've come to understand that by embracing challenges, we can achieve personal growth, and despite my limited experience in programming, I can still make a significant contribution to a programming team.</p>

         <h1 class="heading ">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h1>
<p class ="script">Values, empathy, and self-awareness play a critical role in learning and programming. Here's how:

    Values: Our personal values guide our choices, beliefs, and behaviors, and they can significantly impact our learning and programming experience. When we share and align with a set of shared values such as honesty, integrity, and respect, we create a positive learning and working environment that fosters trust, collaboration, and growth.
    Empathy: Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, and it is a crucial skill for effective communication and teamwork in programming. When we practice empathy, we can appreciate others' perspectives and be more supportive, patient, and respectful in our interactions. This can create a more inclusive and collaborative programming environment, where everyone feels valued and encouraged to contribute.
    Self-awareness: Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand our emotions, strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. It helps us to identify our learning style, set goals, and manage our time and resources effectively. In programming, self-awareness allows us to acknowledge our limitations, seek feedback, and learn from our mistakes. This helps us to improve our skills and become better programmers over time.
    Overall, values, empathy, and self-awareness are essential skills that can help us to become more effective learners and programmers. By practicing and prioritizing these skills, we can create a more positive, collaborative, and supportive programming environment, where everyone can thrive and succeed.</p>

    <h1 class="header">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>

    <p class="script">It is surprising to learn that the Core learning program places a significant emphasis on fostering a positive mental and emotional environment for its programming students.
        And that the core learning program has made me more proficient to some degree to able to fullfill deadline requirements. However in saying that I have found the core learning to be very challenging to say the least. 
        The recognition of the impact of mental and emotional well-being on productivity is commendable, and it is essential to prioritize this aspect of learning to help students achieve their full potential.
    </p>

    <h1 class="header">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>

    <p class="script">Trying to remember where things go. Ifeel like coding is like being a 
        mechanic. You have all these basic parts for how a vehicle works but then you have to remeber that some parts 
        for some cars arent the same and work in a very different way than others. Along side that is the blogging aspect 
        which is great I think  as well. 
    </p>

    <h1 class="header">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h1>

    <p class="script">Since starting to study the core content, I have noticed an improvement in how I approach difficult problems. 
        As our brain is the most critical tool in this field, the strategies learned in the Core program provide the optimal environment for our brains to function effectively.
         Therefore, it makes sense that these strategies are incorporated into the curriculum to help learners reach their full potential in their programming work.</p>

     <h1 class="header">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h1>    
     <p class="script">The answer to whether the time spent studying the Core learning feels like a waste of time or not depends on the individual's learning goals and experiences. For some people, practicing programming may be the best way to learn, while for others, a structured learning program such as the Core learning may be more beneficial. The Core program provides a comprehensive and structured approach to learning programming, which can be helpful for individuals who are new to programming and need to build a strong foundation of knowledge.

        Furthermore, the Core program offers additional benefits that may be difficult to replicate through self-practice alone. These benefits include the opportunity to engage with a supportive community, receive feedback from experienced mentors and instructors, and access a range of resources and tools to facilitate learning.
        
        In this sense, studying the Core content is not a waste of time. It provides essential skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, time management, and giving and receiving feedback, which are crucial for programming. The skills learned through the Core program can help individuals perform better in their programming tasks and overall learning process.</p>
