      Hello and welcome to my web development journey my name is Timothy Tawanda Itayi, I am from Zimabawe orgininally but moved to 
      Auckland,New zealand when i was around 9 years old. Through out my life i have always been interested in web devlopment and everything it
      has to offer but was always distracted by other ventures. I used to be a 2D animator, mainly posting fight choreography from my favourite anime or Anime music videos
      i would find from youtube. I dabled in photography form my then girlfriend at the time which also steered me to modeling for a little bit( nothing special there, mainly other young  photographers
      on instagram). After a wee while i dipped my toe in the entertainment industry ( The most proud work i did was a play back in 2019 in Dunedin called the Flick).
