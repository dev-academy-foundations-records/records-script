       Bootcamp Learning-plan
            <h1 class="heading">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>

            <p class-="paragraph">My long-term career goals are still being developed, but I found the challenges in the Foundations course to be the most enjoyable. I believe I would enjoy working as a FullStack Developer, creating fun and useful products. Game development similar to my main plan</p>
            
        <h1 class="heading">What do you believe will be your biggest strengths and limitations during Bootcamp?</h1>

        <p class-="paragraph">My greatest strengths are my love of learning, my enthusiasm for challenges, and my concern for others, even if I don't know them. I believe these qualities will enable me to complete tasks, make the most of my time at Dev Academy, and contribute positively in a team environment. My biggest limitations will still be my perfectionism, which I am working on, and my tendency to be introverted with my time. However, as I am aware of these limitations, I will do my best to stay on top of them.</p>


        <h1 class="heading">What do you believe will be your biggest non-technical challenge during Bootcamp?</h1>

        <p class-="paragraph">Honestly  most of my porblems are from the technical point of view. </p>

        <h1 class="heading">What non-technical, human skills would you like to develop during your time at Dev Academy?</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">I dont have any apart from maybe a leadership role or just bieng confident in my approach to things. For example I would like to be more confident in my knowledge when speaking to other programmers</p>

        <h1 class="heading">What are your expectations of the Bootcamp team?</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">I expect the Bootcamp team to have effective communication, show respect, and be reasonably available when I need their support.</p>

        <h1 class="heading">What are your expectations of yourself during Bootcamp?</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">I expect myself to stay focused on each task, persevere through challenges, and remember to be kind to myself when facing difficult situations.

        </p>

        Learning Plan
          <h1 class="heading">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>

            <p class="paragraph"> My long term goal is to one day develop video games for my favourite sim racing companies like 
            (I.e polyphony, who have made the highly celebrated Grand Torismo</p>

          <h1 class="heading">Description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>

          <p class="paragraph">My strengths generally come from my ability to push through a lot of work without stopping.
             If I have eaten that is. 
             If I eat a medium to large sized  meal in the morning I can stay pretty much wired in for the remainder of the day.
              However there is a caveat to this which is I can get lost in the work so much and when I get stuck I have reached my limits and no longer continue.</p>

<h1 class="heading">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </h1>

<p class="paragraph">To ask for help a lot sooner instead of trying to figure it out for too long</p>

<h1 class="heading">How you will manage your workload in this programme?
    explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives?</h1>

    <p class="paragraph">The way I would go about managing my workload would be to make sure that I ask questions and communicate how I am feeling about the work. 
        I do think its important to have a steady stream of communication with not just your cohort but your facilitator about the work.
         And to know that they are right there with you to help you push through the heavy load. </p>

         <h1 class="heading">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</h1>

         <p class="paragraph">Take a deep breath.
             Remove yourself from the device and do something unrelated to the work. </p>

             <h1 class="heading">How and where  you will  seek help in a timely way and I expect from my Facilitation team?</h1>

             <p class="paragraph">Well for starters I would seek help through the provided channels given like Discord and soon to be Slack and I Expect my facilitation team to hopefully be there when I need.
                 So far during my experience in Sprint 2 I have been met with kind and generous replies from everyone.</p>
