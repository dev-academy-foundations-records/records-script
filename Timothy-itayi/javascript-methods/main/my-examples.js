// Write your two examples here

    //The math.random() method is a function in the JavaScript Math object that returns a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). In other words, it generates a pseudo-random number in the range [0, 1).
    //It's commonly used in applications like generating random numbers for games, simulations, or other similar applications where a random outcome is desired.
   let  randomNumeral = Math.random();


    //array-method: .push(element)
    //It modifies the original array and returns the new length of the array.
    let fruits = ['apple', 'banana'];
fruits.push('cherry');
console.log(fruits); // Outputs: [ 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry' ]
