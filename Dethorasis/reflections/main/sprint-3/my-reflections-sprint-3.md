# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

I would say I have a bias for mindfulness. I actually really enjoy the idea that emotional intelligence
is important in not only the workplace, but ourselves as well. I would however rationalize it and
say that in an interview space EQ is important absolutely, but rarely is anyone able to make a completely
astute judgement on the character of a person based on one or two meetings. There are plenty of people in the tech
industry that are not emotionally intelligent and they still end up as managers!

### How did you find the overall experience?

The overall experience was fine, not particularly hard and was quite interesting.

### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness?

I've decided that I will practice mindfulness for 10 minutes per day in the morning before breakfast. I am going
to try some of those meditations specifically for mindfulness. I may switch this or perhaps add another one in the afternoon
if I find it to be helpful (afternoons are usually where I'm at a higher stress point).

# Listening and Looping

### What was it like to be fully listened to?

I talked quite slowly and deliberately, but it was still surprising to see everything I had said summed up and understood quite
well.

### What was it like to fully listen?

Fully listening with mindfulness I actually do have experience with at my previous job as a consultant.
I found it quite easy, but only if I am conscious of the fact that I do need to be fully listening. Otherwise
it is quite difficult to be fully listening outside of that.

# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?

I noticed that I needed a visual example of my code running. I found it difficult to get past the things I was stuck on by myself without actually visually seeing how my code is running.

### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?

I did not keep within the timebox suggestions, I was a lot quicker. This is because I have had some previous exposure to JS. I found most of the concepts were good revision as opposed to learning anything new. It was enjoyable to try 'for loops' again.

# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?

Yes I found the lecture to be very helpful. I have not had much exposure to the DOM and so it was quite good to see how it interacts.

It was cool to see how after 40 minutes of programming and following the workshop I did have a working program.

### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?

I was not aware that the DOM is actually something seperate from Javascript and it actually a web API. It works in multiple programming languages.
