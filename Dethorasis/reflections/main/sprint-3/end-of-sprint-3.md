# Final Reflections - Sprint Three

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I was very confident with the Intro to Javascript. I was able to complete it relatively easy, although the use of forEach was a bit difficult for me.

DOM manipulation was something new. Whilst I found I could use the DOM easily enough (I can just google what the exact terminology is when I want to grab something by element id) I did struggle with easily summarizing what it actually is.

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?

The Intro to Javascript section.

### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?

Probably the research and reflection on the blog. I felt the timebox on it wasn't accurate, as I still have to go and research, write and factor it so it's on my blog properly.

### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?

During this sprint instead of completing 8 hours a day like I had previously, I instead focused on completing the learning competencies and doing 40ish hours over the entirety of the week. I did struggle with the DOM a bit, and taking a break and coming back with a new perspective really did help keep me at it.
