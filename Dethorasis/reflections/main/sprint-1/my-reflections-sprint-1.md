# My Reflections - Sprint One

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?

The command line is basically a list of commands that you normally would do with a visual interface (i.e.) on windows. Instead of creating a folder by right clicking with my mouse I instead enter ‘mkdir’ and this creates a folder for me to add things into.
Instead of pressing ‘back’ to go back to the previous directory I type ‘cd ..’
Instead of “clicking” what I want to do on the PC, I instead type it out.

The best analogy I could think of is a robot performs the instructions given to it.

### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

I did not stick to the timeline as the introductory video had more or less taken me through these commands.

In hindsight, I would spend more time internalizes the various linux commands given.

### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1. cd - changes your directory, like moving from one folder to other
2. ls - lists the contents of the directory, all the visible files
3. mkdir - makes a new directory, creates a new folder essentially
4. rmdir - removes a directory, not possible if it is not empty
5. touch - to create a file, remember to add the .filetype at the end

### Did you learn anything unexpected?

I learnt that I can create different files depending on their file type set (i.e. .txt)

# Version Control with Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?

Github is a 'version control' software that developers use to ‘pull down’ and upload (push) data to enable easy collaboration. It's used because without it multiple people writing different changes on one project can get messy, and they might accidentally override or alter someone else's work.

Git is the version control system based on your local machine and it lets you manage and keep track of your code history and repositories (working folders). It works as a command line interface on Linux.
GitHub is the cloud based system in which Git uploads and downloads data into and from the main project.

### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?

Literally the tree from avatar where they download and upload memories, except in this case they can alter them as well.

### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?

The best differentiation I have in my head right now, is that GitHub is essentially the 'cloud' where the master code lives and any differentiation decisions are made. I think I can remember that.

### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

No, I think it took me about 20 minutes less time as the workshop really did explain quite well what we were doing and it isn’t my first exposure to Git.

# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a Git workflow?

Git workflow is like a tree and its branches that developers follow to accomplish work in a productive and consistent manner.

You start with the master branch which has all the well tested code and then have another branch which is for development. You might have two other branches off of this for features. When work is completed on one branch it is "pulled" down into another or merged.

### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

This particular section took me longer than anticipated. I had to delete repos and files that I had made before as a result of missing a page in the section. However, through these mistakes I did get a much better grasp of the various commands and things I can do in Git.

When I was blocked I stepped away from my computer and did something else. I think it was helpful to come back with a fresh mindset.

### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?

I would have separated my Udacity directories from my devacademy directories from the beginning so that my repos were separated. I spent a lot of time re-organizing my directories because I had repos inside of other repos.

# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?

A staging is the preparatory process in which you add files to the area that are eventually going to be uploaded to the repository. A staging step allows you to continue making changes in the working directory before you change things into the repository.

Separating the staging and the commit allows you to customize what is added to the commit.

# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?

Main is the main working branch in the local repository. This branch should be where the working code is and any changes done in an alternate branch.

### Why create a Branch?

A branch provides a copy of the main, and allows you to experiment and change without causing the main branch any errors. This is especially good when multiple developers are working on multiple things.

### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?

The concepts itself feel easier to understand, but feel far more difficult to explain. Also difficult to remember all the commands needed.

# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?

One example of when you might fork a project is when you are creating a project collaboratively with different people around the world and you don't want them to be able to affect your main tree of development without your permission.

You might also fork a project when you want to use someone elses code as a base of your own.

### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

Just now when explaining why you might use a fork. It's easy to think of forking as a "clone" of a project but you are not actually "cloning" the repo down. You are "cloning" down the forked repo.

# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?

I didn't really feel frustrated with this exercise as by this point it felt quite simple to create a repository on GitHub. It was a new experience to change the settings of it however, and turn it into a website.

Cloning the repo down was quite simple, as well as creating an html file, commiting the changes and pushing it back up.

At this point I just wonder at what point would one start working in a different branch from the main tree.

### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

The idea in my head is that html works as the bare bones and foundation of the website. CSS is the coloring/sizing and language that makes the website more aesthetic, and JS performs the logic (i.e. when a user enters input).

I didn't know that we could have basic websites hosted from GitHub.

# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?

My process so far for solving problems has actually been to try and solve a large problem without breaking it down into smaller problems. I often struggle to break down a larger problem into smaller ones.

I like thinking about the programming problem of finding the largest of 10 numbers. I struggled to think of a way to do that until the suggestion that I should instead think of a way to find the larger of two numbers and build from there.

### Have a look at what the internet says on how to think like a programmer. What patterns do you see? What do you notice?

A lot of the sources on the internet mention breaking down a large problem into smaller bite sized problems or instructions. When problem solving its good to talk through the problem and explain it. Ask yourself how would you solve a similar, easier problem?

Above all I need to train myself to think linearly. Try one thing, if that doesn't work go down the list and try the next thing. Break it down into smaller chunks, just like we are doing in this sprint and be persistent.

Programmers need to be able to identify patterns, and they can recognize these patterns by improving their problem solving abilities.

### What does the internet say about flipped learning? What is flipped learning and flipped classroom? How do you think it will relate to your learning journey?

Flipped learning is the teaching style in which content, information and lectures is accessable by students at any time. It aims to increase student engagement by having students complete readings at home and work on live problems during class.

In a traditional classroom an instructor gives a lecture and the students a given homework to demonstrate understanding. In a flipped classroom students watch lectures/readings before coming to class and the actual class time is devoted to problem solving.

In terms of my learning journey this will be beneficial as i'll be able get help as I need it, as opposed to having homework and not being able to get help for it. To be able to have "live" problem solving anytime (during the day) is going to be extremely helpful.

It will be important however to ensure that I have consumed the necessary preparatory content.

# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?

It wasn't particularly difficult to introduce myself, but I definitely did have to think carefully about what my values. The one that really shone the most to me was that I don't believe anything is pre-ordained. You make what you want out of what comes your way.

### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?

I didn't feel particularly self conscious. I've never really minded introductions. I find them kind of fun.
