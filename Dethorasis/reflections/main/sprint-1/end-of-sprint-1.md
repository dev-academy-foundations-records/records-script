# Final Reflections - Sprint One

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?

I found it surprisingly easy to sit down and spend 8 hours working on the tech challenges. Being mentally challenged by these problems was actually very engaging and I felt myself learning a lot.

My plan was originally to do 25 minutes and then a small break following the Pomodoro method, but in honesty, being quite engaged I didn't need to and happily spent 3-4 hours progressing through the questions.

With the core questions I found them to be quite difficult and not so engaging as the tech questions. I did not follow my plan well and procrastinated trying to think of answers. The pomodoro method would have been better used here. I need to remember to follow it.

Another problem I faced was using Toggl in my learning strategy. I have tried to used it multiple times, but I just end up forgetting about it. I tracked my time using the PC clock and not Toggl.

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I am quite confident with most of the learning competencies. I do need to do some revision (which will be done by the end of this week) on pulling, merging, and forking. It would also be beneficial for me to go through the linux commands again.

I am not confident with the Identity, Values and Strengths. I struggled a lot with that.

### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?

I enjoyed learning the Git & GitHub competencies. It was fun to go through and explore the terminal commands, create and update files and then push them up to my own repo on GitHub.

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

I found that whilst some parts of the reflections process were good and actually made me absorb information better, I really struggled with and did not enjoy the Identity, Values and Strengths section.

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

Yes, absolutely. I did really push myself to upload my Koe-Wai-Koe quicker since I saw people had already uploaded on Monday. I had to remind myself that I had a lot of time in the week and that not everyone here is starting at the same place.

I felt like I could have focused more during this sprint, and to some degree I do think that is true.
