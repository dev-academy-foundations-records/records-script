# My Reflections - Sprint Five

# Tic-Tac-Toe

### What was the most challenging part of this exercise for you?

The most challenging part of this exercise was writing the psuedocode
and trying to map out every part of this exercise. I found it difficult to know
where my functions should go and what should go into them! Honestly the best way around this was just to start. And then redo it, and then redo it again.

After restarting a couple times I had a good semblance of where everything should go, but everytime I restarted I would keep my psuedocode and just move it around.

It took a lot of walking away and thinking about the problem, a lot of different tic-tac-toe tutorials for ideas on the different ways to complete this exercise. Eventually I
was able to construct something that did work and that I was happy with.

I was also very stuck on how to reset the game. I went with just a total page reset which came from one of my facilitators.

### What learning(s) are you going to takeaway from this exercise?

The biggest learning to take away from this exercise I think was actually using a for loop with an .onclick method that would execute a function (every time its clicked). I found that to be a very cool use of a loop, which I will retain for the future.

# Pair Programming

### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?

I have no prior experience in pair coding. This exercise was definitely difficult for me to be a driver. I definitely found it easier following instruction, rather than driving it haha.

### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during Bootcamp? Why so?

I don't think working with others will be an issue for me as long as I have time comprehend what I'm writing, it should be okay.

As a driver I might struggle, because breaking down the code in my head is difficult to translate into instruction.

# Inflate the Unicorn

### Did you learn anything new during this exercise? What was it?

This exercise was good revision and practice using the .addEventListener method which I had been struggling to effectively to use haha.

### Did you encounter issues completing any of the steps of this exercise? How did you resolve this?

I encountered a lot of issues trying to complete this exercise. In all honesty the code works completely fine, but I am not happy with it. The code is wet and not DRY-coded, that is to say I repeated myself to complete this exercise.

My biggest issue was how I could individually select each unicorn when I clicked them. I did a lot of googling and saw a lot to do with the 'event' or 'target' methods, but I really struggled in just selecting one of them without running into some sort of error.

Ultimately I spent too much time on this exercise. I left the previous code in as comments, just so I can go back to it next week and really try complete it using an array/loop solution.

One thing to note for the learning competency. Instead of concatenenating a string (i.e. ./images/unicorn-1.png tied to a loop which would update it to unicorn-2) I instead opted to tie the unicorn images to a counter.

### If you were to replace the unicorn with another mystical animal of your choice, what would it be?

A goblin for sure ðŸ˜‚

# Whack-a-mole

### What was the hardest part of this exercise?

I was stuck on this exercise for a long time. The hardest part was visualizing how to properly manipulate the table cells in JS. I found it hard to psuedocode and realize that my cells needed to be manipulated after I had got the entire tables id.

One I managed to this (through A LOT of googling and starting over) it was quite easy to create a randomMole variable up 25 (number of cells). Adding the appendChild method was quite straightforward.

I also struggled with the whackedMole function. I couldn't figure out how to make it seperate from the for loop. Whenever I called it in the for loop, i'd get an error, so I just left inside the loop.

### Can you think of any different ways you could have accomplished the same outcome?

I could have created an empty array perhaps and populated it with HTML elements? I also could have seperated my whackedMole function from my for-loop, but I'm still not sure how to do that.

I also didn't need to use for loops. I'm pretty sure I could of use 'for of' but it was just the most comfortable syntax for me because I can plainly see what is going on.

# Dress the Clown

### How did you find the process of refactoring your code?

Refactoring the code wasn't too difficult. All I had to really do was add an '&&' operator to my if elses and write write some functions that would be executes if those parameters were true.

The biggest issue for me is that I was not able to complete the challenge using completely DRY code. I was forced to create seperate functions for left and right clothes and shoes. I will hopefully have time this revision week to go back and implement a way to do this without repeating myself :)

I found I really had some good flow during this exercise, once I got over the hurdle of calling a function with arrow keys, it was fairly easy (wet code not withstanding).

### Would you do anything differently if you were to start this challenge again?

Definitely I'll go back and see if I can implement some kind of loop in my functions to execute left and right key changes, instead of just creating a whole bunch of different functions.

### What piece of code are you proudest of from this exercise?

Definitely the addEventListener method with the function inside of it. That was a bit complicated.

# JS Carnival

### What parts of these challenges did you enjoy? If we were to add more challenges, what would you like to have more of?

I think I definitely enjoyed whack-a-mole the most. This was surprising to me because I thought working with an array fetched through the DOM would be very complicated.

Fortunately once I had actually managed to manipulate a cell, all the rest fell into place.

I'd like to see something like a very simplistic space invaders game.

### What parts weren't so good? Were there any parts that you felt stuck on?

I was very stuck on the Unicorn game. I felt it was quite hard for me to grasp using a loop to implement what I wanted. I will go back during the revision week and redo it. Honestly after doing the mole game I do kind of have an idea on how I might implement it.

### Which parts made you feel confident?

Tic-Tac-Toe and the Mole Game.

### What personally would you want changed to improve the carnival?

Maybe a little more instruction on the first exercise? I honestly found the second easier than the first. But everyone is different in how they understand things.
