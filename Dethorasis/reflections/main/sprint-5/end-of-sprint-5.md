# Final Reflections - Sprint Five

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?

Once I had my own blog built. It was nice to see my own piece of the internet that I had built myself.

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?

This week was the hardest, struggling a lot with the Unicorn game and the clown.

### Was Foundations what you expected it to be like? If not, what was different?

It was what I expected it to be I think. I probably expected it to be slightly more intense, but rather it felt like the intensity of it was hidden. You definitely could think you could miss a week, but if you did there was probably no catching up.

### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?

None, although I did really have to take a lot of breaks. What kept my going was desire to solve the problems in front of me, and the desire to become a programmer in the industry.

### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?

I definitely don't feel ready, but I feel close. This next revision week will be exactly what I need to really hone in the concepts. I will treat this week as 8 hour days.

### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?

Do the little things, so you can spend a lot of time on the bigger things without being distracted.

### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?

Yes. Well the simple fact that I have programmed. I have a blog where I have shown what I have programmed and what I've learned. I'm not very good at the moment, but I feel like I am programmer.
