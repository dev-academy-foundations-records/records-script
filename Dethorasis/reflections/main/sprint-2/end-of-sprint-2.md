# Final Reflections - Sprint Two

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?

I am feeling confident in the learning competencies from this sprint.
I would struggle with new things like grid rows etc, but I think I managed to make my website basically resizable.

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?

I easily breezed through the freeCodeCamp exercises.
Putting them into practice was much much harder.

### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?

Definitely seeing some of the cohorts very well polished websites hahaa.
I also grew anxious when I was completely blocked with implemented media queries. It took me a couple of
hours before I asked for help, because I thought I could figure it out.

### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?

I definitely felt very critical of myself this time. But I did take a moment to tell myself that
many of these flash websites and blogs have been made by people with industry or adjacent experience.

It didn't stop my work flow very much, but I did feel very frustrated in the beginning.

### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?

I would say that you lay out all the sections of your website linearly through something called HTML.
These sections are called elements by various names such as body, headers, divs etc.
After you do this, you would then manipulate these elements into various colors, shapes, sizes and fonts through
something called CSS which adds 'style' to your website.

If you are familiar with programming you might consider 'media queries' to be 'if' statements in your website.
If someone browsing your website was on a small device like a phone you could use a media query to again manipulate
your elements to ensure that your website remains readable and responsive across a wide range of devices.
