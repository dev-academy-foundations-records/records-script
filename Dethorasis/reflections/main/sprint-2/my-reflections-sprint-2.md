# My Reflections - Sprint Two

# Your Blog

### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?

In this exercise I created an HTML file inside the Gitpages repository with template story text. I did forget to push the changes, only commited.

I then created a CSS file in a different directory (same repository) where I will work on the design and style of the website. I think linked my css file to the HTML page. Now any changes on the css page will affect the html file.

### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?

So far so good, it took me less time than I needed to follow the guide and set up the blog. I did stop and rewind the sprint 2 workshop video a couple times to ensure I understood the concepts.

# Learn HTML and CSS

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?

I really struggled with 'radio' button attributes in the first basic HTML course. Giving each of the radio and checkbox attributes like value was quite a simple task, however the code was looking very complicated and really required me to read through.

I feel like the instructions were plain, but not particularly explanative. I really had to read through every line of the instructions to understand where I should add value attributes.

Another obstacle I had was remembering the override structure in CSS in terms of where/what would override a class.

It helped a lot to draw a table that demonstrated that classes are overrided by the last class as CSS is read downwards.

Additionally I struggled with this particular learning objective because it can be difficult to remember what exactly you were struggling with. From now on I will keep my reflections tab open when I start a new learning objective so I can immediately note down what I am struggling/doing well with.

### What are of you proud of from this challenge?

I'm proud of the fact that I got through all the freeCodeCamp challenges in a relatively timely manner. It didn't take me 10 hours to complete, so I had plenty of time to go back and re-study the concepts I wasn't particularly sure.

Additionally I'm proud of the fact that I have learnt to keep my reflections in mind at all times whilst I am learning tech content. This will enable me to learn better.

# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?

I noticed that I really struggled with absorbing all of the information in the video, it went very fast. Fortunately I had some minor exposure to some of these concepts previously, especially in the DevTools Sandbox.

I definitely noticed that if I've at least seen a concept before I can really pick it up a lot better.

My strength during this challenge I think has been tenacity. Today I was very determined to ensure I did a significant amount of work for an 8 hour block and I think I did so because I had previously said to myself that I would do it.

My limitations was definitely staying focused for more than 30 minutes at a time. For the next challenge I will employ the Pomodoro timer for 45 minutes and try and maintain that work flow.

I was not able to stay in the time box window, it just felt like too much for too little time to grasp any of the concepts without rewinding and pausing.

### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?

I didn't have any blocks in this challenge, rather I needed to slow down, pause and rewind the video many times. My block was time management I think.

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

This task was very mentally intensive I think, so I don't have any distraction tabs open :D

My distractions were mode real-life i.e. pacing and thinking about concepts when I should just be progressing.

### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.

I was able to manipulate some elements in the EDA handbook :)

# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.

Personally, I like to think of website development like the anatomy of a human. You could consider HTML to be the 'bones' of the website. Without HTML there is nothing to manipulate and would be considered the 'foundation' of your website just as bones are the foundation block of humans.

You could consider CSS then, to be the exterior of a human. Through CSS you customize how your website looks and how it interacts with different devices. It consists of what we "see" when we open a relationship, the same way we can see the hair, eyes, skin etc of another person.

Additionally I might consider Javascript to be the brain of the website:)

### Any moments of surprise or joy?

Absolute joy after finally managing to make my divs at least semi-responsive to resizing. It still definitely needs some work.

### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?

HTML I would consider to be a sloth. It doesn't care about how it looks, it simply does what it needs to.
CSS would be like a peacock in that color and style are its main points.
