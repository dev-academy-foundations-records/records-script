# Final Reflections - Sprint Four

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I'm confident in just about every part, aside from manipulating objects
in JS. That might need a bit of work outside of just being prompted to do it.

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?

Completing the FizzBuzz exercise easily.

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?

Definitely the Scooby builtin method.

### How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?

Instead of doing large blocks of coding this sprint, I instead encouraged myself
to program as I wanted as long as I still put at least 40 hours.

Honestly I wouldn't do this all the time, but with all the recent stuff going on
(floods, doctors appointments etc) I did find that I could still be quite productive even without setting myself large blocks of time. Quality > quantity.

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say?

Remember that you don't always have to call your function. You just need to write the function and pass the test.
