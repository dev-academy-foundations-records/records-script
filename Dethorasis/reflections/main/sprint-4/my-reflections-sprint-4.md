# My Reflections - Sprint Four

# Code Readability

### What makes code more readable for you?

For me readable code has commenting and effective spacing. HTML code is quite easy to read,
but after cleaning up my indentation on one of my blog pages I have to admit it is remarkable more aesthetic to look at.

### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?

After just learning about the differences I find tabs to be easier to use.

### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?

My workspace is a little bit cluttered. I think my code isn't necessarily a reflection of that (if we are not counting my blog because that is just a mess).

# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    let expected = 7
    let actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```

### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`:

```
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
```

### Do you think you would prefer using Test Driven Development? Why?

Honestly, no. I can see why it would be very useful though. You can essentially "map out" what you're going to do in your program before you've written any actual code, but I think I would struggle more with TDD than writing code linearly.

# Kata

### How did you find using repl.it in practice? Confusing? Useful?

### Was it helpful to look at the tests while coding the kata?

It was helpful to look at the tests, however I did find it confusing, not understanding that I wasn't supposed to be calling some of my functions, and just purely writing them.

### What problem solving techniques did you implement in your coding flow?

After I figured out that I should be using console.log in my functions and locate the output on the 'npm run test' to see what I was getting.

After a while I recognize that when the console was not able to find my arguments passed into the function it was usually because I hadn't done something to it yet. (e.g. you can't use the find() function if you haven't converted the argument into an array.)

### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?

I found Super FizzBuzz to be relatively easy compared to the other methods. There were relatively straightforward instructions.

The hardest part was writing the pseudocode for the exercise.

### Did you want to change and refactor your code once you were finished?

Not really. I think the code could be simplified, but its quite straightforward to look at it, and therefore I would keep it the same.

I suppose I could change the for loop to a map() method.

### Reflections

## What was it like to be fully listened to?

It was interesting for the other person to be able to fully grasp what I had over those prescribed two minutes, however the overall explanation of what I had been talking about for over two minutes only really required about 30 seconds to fully sum up :)

## What was it like to fully listen?

I noticed it really requires some serious presence and mindfulness to actually fully recognise what the other person is saying and actually commit that to your memory so that you could explain what they had said.
