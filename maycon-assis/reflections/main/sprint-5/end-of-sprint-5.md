# Final Reflections - Sprint Five

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?

I enjoyed pretty much all the tech exercises so when I was able to complete each one, it was a good feeling.

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?

I wouldn't say I felt bad at any point. It did come with a few frustrations and struggles which would temporarily drop my mood. I don't consider myself good or a fan of writing so I did struggle with all the writing involved.

### Was Foundations what you expected it to be like? If not, what was different?

Coming in, I actually expected to have more of a workload. But it was very manageable. I also didn't expect to be writing as much as I was with all the blog posts.
I also didn't really expect to have as much core work involved.

### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?

I never wanted to give up. But one or two times I did get beyond frustrated with my lack of ability to understand and complete a challenge. I tried to see the big picture
and look back to see how much I was learning overall in such a short amount of time. It kept me going.

### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?

I feel ready to move to this next phase and face the new challenges that will come with it. I feel prepared and over the next few days, I'll be doing a lot of revision on all the concepts covered in foundations to hit the ground running in Bootcamp.

### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?

It might say something along the lines of "Don't worry, just keep going and give your best effort, everything will fall into place and make sense very soon".

### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?

Yes! Albeit a very amateur and inexperienced once. I guess it was the confidence boost I got from the javascript carnaval and overall, being able to complete foundations!
