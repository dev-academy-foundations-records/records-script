# My Reflections - Sprint Five

# Tic-Tac-Toe

### What was the most challenging part of this exercise for you?

I would say just trying to figure out and come up with the logic for the main block of the code. More specifically, creating the condition to end the game so it doesn't allow the user to keep playing. I spent a good amount of time on it and I was always going through the logic
in my head to see if it made sense and where the bugs could potentially be coming from.

### What learning(s) are you going to takeaway from this exercise?

The importance of how you order and structure your code. A few times I had to change the order of a few lines of code because the logic
wasn't adding up. Always think of the logic before you actually start coding and pseudocode it. This is something that has been taught and
encouraged throughout foundations but during this exercise I was again reminded how many headaches it can save you from having later on.
Be very selective about the method or path you choose to complete a task because depending on what you choose, it may cause you problems later on and make you have to change things. Be efficient.

# Pair Programming

### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?

I have no prior experience pair programming. It seems like an effective way to tackle a difficult problem as there are two thinkers involved. Also a way to share information and learn different approaches and methods. But I don't know how practical it is while doing real world projects. Couldn't you just use GitHub collaboratively and basically achieve the same outcome? I guess I'll find out in Bootcamp!

### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during Bootcamp? Why so?

I don't necessarily think it will be a challenge. Although I might need some time to fully get used to it and develop an efficient and beneficial approach.

# Inflate the Unicorn

### Did you learn anything new during this exercise? What was it?

I learned how you can use state variables to keep track of moving parts and how I could use string interpolation effectively.

### Did you encounter issues completing any of the steps of this exercise? How did you resolve this?

Yes! In my first attempt, I was struggling to find a way to efficiently refer to each unicorn and because of this I had to write the same code multiple times for each of them, which would all do the same thing. I went to discord and saw that some people were facing the same issue. After receiving some tips and watching
a workshop I found out that I could create an object to hold the state of each unicorn and refer to them in the function using bracket notation. This made my code
a thousand times cleaner and I wasn't running into anymore issues.

### If you were to replace the unicorn with another mystical animal of your choice, what would it be?

Centaur. They just look so badass.

# Whack-a-mole

### What was the hardest part of this exercise?

There wasn't anything particularly hard about this exercise. I did get stuck for a while in my whacked mole function because I was using
the same random integer and random cell variable and for hours I was wondering why it wasn't working. Then I watched the workshop
on it and couldn't believe it. After generating a new random variable and random cell, my code finally worked.

### Can you think of any different ways you could have accomplished the same outcome?

This is probably the best way of doing it that I can think of and surprisingly, it was my first approach.

# Dress the Clown

### How did you find the process of refactoring your code?

It didn't go that well. I know for a fact that there is a much better way of doing it just by looking at how long my code is and how much I had to repeat lines of code. I know in my head how I can improve it but I just don't have enough understanding or experience with javascript structures to code it up.

### Would you do anything differently if you were to start this challenge again?

I still haven't found a better way of doing this exercise, so as of now, I would probably start the exact same way. I'm happy that I got it to work perfectly but it still needs a lot of work to be anywhere near an ideal code for this certain exercise.

### What piece of code are you proudest of from this exercise?

I would say the function I created for the 'keydown' event. It was my first time using a key to execute code, which was pretty cool.

# JS Carnival

### What parts of these challenges did you enjoy? If we were to add more challenges, what would you like to have more of?

I enjoyed pretty much all of it. I felt as if it was just the right amount of challenging. I found myself thinking a lot and it definitely pushed me. I would
say any challenge that gives you the opportunity to write javascript from scratch is great. It really does test your problem solving skills but also having the instructions to fall back on was a great thing.

### What parts weren't so good? Were there any parts that you felt stuck on?

I got stuck a few times on all the exercises but it was nothing out of the ordinary. The big one was the 'whacked mole' function which was basically just me having
a mind lapse and eventually realising a simple and obvious fix. I also got stuck on the Inflate The Unicorn challenge for a while before I was shown some concepts that could help me solve it, which they did.

### Which parts made you feel confident?

I would say the Dress The Clown exercise. I got it to work perfectly, extremely quickly. Even though it's a relatively ugly code, It still gave me a huge confidence boost when I pressed on the arrows keys and saw that it was working without fault.

### What personally would you want changed to improve the carnival?

Honestly, you can never have too many games at a carnival! So I would say more games! Other than that, I can't think of anything in particular. All of the games are instantly a classic to me and I will forever remember them.
