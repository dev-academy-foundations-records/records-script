# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?

overall I would decent. I feel decently confident with HTML But when it comes to CSS I still feel lost a lot of the time as to what I need to do to make it look how I want it to. Also I haven't developed any sort of workflow while working with CSS and there is so many things I'm still oblivious to. My understanding of media queries and DevTools could also be better.

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?

The setup section, learning HTML and CSS. Especially when it came to using HTML and creating a flow with it. I also felt I left the JavaScript Primer section with a good understanding.

### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?

Definitely while adding HTML and CSS to my blog. It took me a very long time to get things to kind of look the way I wanted them to. A lot of trial and error was involved. Also the technical blog section as I feel like I'm not the best at explaining concepts. 

### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?

There was definitely a lot more of that going on this time. But it was mostly encouragement considering I was making good progress with my blog. Just to be able to get something that doesn't look horrible and operates how I want it to up live was a great feeling. It definitely motivated me even more. 

### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?

I would probably say. Well essentially you write what you want to say on a notepad, then on another notepad you decide how you want what you just wrote on that first notepad to look like. To keep it simple.
