# My Reflections - Sprint Two

# Your Blog 

### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?

Basically, in this exercise I created a "blog" directory and added an HTML file. I also then pasted some code in this HTML file. Then I visited the page on my web browser. Next, I then created a "styles" directory and added a CSS file into it. Both the "blog" and "styles" directories were inside the same parent directory(maycon-assis.github.io). Now I was able to link the HTML file to the CSS file by swapping out the placeholder link in the HTML file and adding the location of the CSS file. They were now linked. I then opened the newly edited HTML file in my browser using "explorer.exe te-houtaewa-template.html". Finally I staged, comitted and pushed all of these changes to GitHub.

### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?

I'm finding it really useful. It has helped me maintain a decent rhythm and work at a good pace. I like having some sort of time allocation or guideline because it makes me feel more organised. I've also used Toggl Track every session and it's been great.

# Learn HTML and CSS 

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?

During the FreeCodeCamp lessons I did find myself feeling overwhelmed by all the new content and information. Also with some of the lessons, I red through them and completed them but I still hadn't quite understood it or when I would use what was being tought. I started taking a small break every 15 lessons or so to help the feeling of it being overwhelming at times and help the content sink in. It also helped my understanding by working on my own code(VS code) in between courses and trying to implement some of the content I was learning. I found myself watching some extra youtube videos as well about specific stuff I felt I wanted a better understanding of.

### What are of you proud of from this challenge?

I'm proud that I was able to finish the three courses with a relatively good understanding of HTML, CSS and Responsive Web Design. Also my ability to remain focused during these courses. Even during the times I got stuck, I was feeling very determined to get unstuck, reflect and learn from it. Also just how motivated I felt while doing these courses. Like I mentioned in the previous question, I was even working on my own separate code(VS code) during the course because I wanted to make sure I really knew what I was doing and wanted to put what I was learning into some more practise.



# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?

I would say that my learning style is receiving a small amount of information about a concept and getting open my web browser/VS code and testing it out for myself. This way I feel like The information sits better in the long run. I also would say I have a pretty average memory at best so if it's a long lesson, a lot of the information gets lost in my head. So I find it helpful to put it into practise immediately. It also gives me a chance to figure some things out on my own just by exploring through.


### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?

Yes! This crash course gave me mixed feelings. I felt it did a good job at explaining the basics of how to use and navigate through the Chrome DevTools inspector but it also dived into alot of content/concepts I am not familiar about a third of the way through the video. From then on, I was mostly lost. I knew that the video was basically going through each tab(Element, Console, Network etc) and explaining what you can do in each one and how they work but I could only really get a firm grasp on the Element tab. Definitely a block for me and I wouldn't say I overcame it in anyway. I just hope that it's okay for now since we haven't covered a a lot of what was going on in that video. I just moved on and watched a few more videos on in but again after the Element tab I was more or less running into the same problems.

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

I actually have seven tabs open right now haha. But luckily they are all just google searches and youtube videos about Dom, DevTools, HTML etc. I know it sounds too good to be true... That's because it is hahaha. I would say 90% of my distractions come from my phone. So for that reason I try to keep it off and in a different room during most of my working time. It helps A LOT!

### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.

Of course! I was just too tempted to find the most prestigious websites and completely redesign them to my liking haha. That obviously meant filling it with immature and unfunny text/headings. I also had a great time messing with the styles of some websites by really just making a mess out of the colour scheme and layout.


# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  

To keep it simple, I will use an analogy. As a musician, I think of HTML like written lyrics to a song. These lyrics are written intentionally and it is the message I'm trying to convey to whoever might listen to it. However, since I intend for it to be a song, I need to create a melody to specify how I want sing it. The melody will ultimately dictate the whole feel of my song and how the listener will receive the message behind it. What emotions do they feel while listening? Is it catchy? Does it make them sing along? The melody will influence the answer to these questions. The melody takes the fixed and static idea of the written lyrics and gives it movement, character and feel. I feel that in a similar way, CSS takes the main content/message that is being put out 
and gives it life and feel thus facilitating how the observer will witness the content. 

### Any moments of surprise or joy? 

I would say there was definitely a moment of joy when I got the navigation bar that held the links to my blog pages to finally sit how I wanted it to. I definitely spent a lot longer than I should have But I was really happy with how it came out and I hope to keep
improving on it. I was also surprised when I saw how much just basic CSS impoved how the page looked as a whole.

### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?

This might be the hardest question in this sprint. Maybe CSS would be one of those multi-coloured birds because you know... all the colour haha. Then HTML would have to be something like an elephant. No disrespect to them but I find elephants to have a very bland 
colour. Not the best analogy I would say haha. However HTML and CSS do rely on each other as much as an elephant needs a multi-coloured bird I guess... uhhhhh I dont really know. I need more time haha.
