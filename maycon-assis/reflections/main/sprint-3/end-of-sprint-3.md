# Final Reflections - Sprint Three 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I would say I'm pretty confident in all the learning competencies, at least when it comes to understanding and being able to explain them.
I could definitely use more practise on the coding side of things. The basic Javascript and manipulating the DOM. This week's core
section was definitely my favourite and I see myself very comfortable understanding and discussing that section. 

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?

During the listening/looping exercise. It was a fun and also funny experience and I got to meet a fellow student. Everytime I completed a
question of the Javascript intro exercises haha. 

### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?

I wouldn't say I was angry at any point in this sprint.

### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?

Probably while reading the DOM material and researching. It was a lot of information at once and I couldn't quite get it at first. But later on in the week it finally made sense to me and it was like it
just clicked out of nowhere and I understood it and could explain it well. Also when doing the Javascript Cafe. Seeing all that code did scare me a bit. Like "How am I supposed to be able to learn how to do this in the short time I'm going to be doing this course". I also started having doubts about if I was going to become good enough to get a job after I completed this course. That motivated me to keep my head up and work harder.
