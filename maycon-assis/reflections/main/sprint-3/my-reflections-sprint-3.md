# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness 

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

Personally I feel it is extremely important to be fully present and consciously aware of what I am experiencing. I wouldn't say I have any biases against it. I believe it's something we all are already capable of but also something we can improve. From personal experience, It is really good at fighting anxiety as it trains your mind to remain in the current moment and
not the future, full of uncertain outcomes.            

### How did you find the overall experience? 

I found it refreshing, as if I was focused on the moment yet relaxed, and a sense of traquility. 

### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness? 
    
I personally prefer taking time through the day to pause whatever I'm doing, look outside and breathe. I try to fit many of these tiny moments throughout the day as opposed to one longer session. I am definitely committed to implementing these in between the sections of each sprint and whenever I feel I need to while doing my DevAcademy work.



# Listening and Looping 

### What was it like to be fully listened to? 

It was an interesting feeling. In normal interations it is very rare for me to talk that much without someone else making a comment. You know how sometimes you can sense when and when you are not being listened to at all? In this exercise I could sense that I was being listened, fully. I could definitely feel a greater sense of connection even with it being the first time meeting and seeing this person. I would say it was a good experience overall.

### What was it like to fully listen?

This also sort of felt unique in a way. I like to think that I'm a good listener but throughout the listening I felt almost the need to say "yeah" in agreement to their statements. It was almost like a non voluntary response. I did find myself focusing a lot harder on what the person was saying. I was trying to absorb as much information as possible. 

# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?

While learning the basic Javascript concepts I noticed that I was really trying to understand them and visualize them in a way that would make sense to me. For example: With Functions, I could do most of the exercises without really knowing what was going on but as soon as I got to a question
that sort of required more steps and was more involving, I got stuck. I then went to discord and got an explanation as to how they work and why they might be useful. It was in simple terms which helped it make more sense to me. Basically just trying to always learn the fundamentals, developing a decent understand of what's going on in the syntax and what each part of the code represents was really crucial to avoid getting blocked later on. Also asking for help and advice on discord was important to getting an explaination that made it a lot easier for me to understand. 

### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?

I'd say relatively well. For most of the concepts I didn't need as much time to get through. But some of them I would spend more time on. I knew that I would forget some of the syntax but I did want to leave being able 
to explain how each of them works in simple terms and how to use them on a basic level.




# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?

I found that it gave me a good insight into how to structure Javascript code and also it did allow me to see first hand how Javascript and the DOM interact together. By using
'document.getElementbyId()' we were able to interact with elements from our HTML document and manipulate them in any way. I also felt that there was some parts of the code which
I knew what the intention was but couldn't quite wrap my head around the thought process and I had a feeling of "Wow, I would've never thought of this". So it did scare me a
 little because I realised how much logical thinking was involved.

### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?

Like I mentioned in the question above, I realised how much my thinking needs to change in terms of approaching certain parts of the code. It can require a lot of logical thinking and keeping
track of all the variables, loops, objects ect. I also realised that a Web Developer won't be able to remember every algorithm that they might need at certain times. So it's perfectly normal to 
have them saved or be able to find them using the internet and copy them into your code. I guess it comes down to where and how you will use them.
