# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?

The command line is nothing more than an interface that is used to access and alter information in your computer by interacting using commands.
The command line is like anything you can give a set of specific instructions too and have it execute those set of instructions immediately.

### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

I did not stick to the timebox guidlines as I was moving alot slower through the content trying to grasp every single piece of information I could and doing extra research/work until I had understood it well.
Next time I will move on quicker as I realise that I will be coming back to use most if not all of what i'm learning now so there is no need to linger too much on a specific concept.

### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1. "pwd" = Basically allows you to see in which directory you're in. 
2. "cd" = Allows me to move across directories.
3. "ls" = This gives me a list of the files and directories that are present in the current working directory. I can also alter this command by adding the "a" flag preceded by a hyphen to show me all the hidden filesand provide more information on them.
4. "code ." = This command opens the current directory in VS Code.
5. "mkdir" "directory-name" = Creates a new directory(named accordingly) in the current working 
directory.


### Did you learn anything unexpected?

I learned that command line is basically used to navigate and manipulate information that is already on your computer. for some reason the thought of having to input commands made it seem like something
much so far and beyond. I view the command line completely different now.

# Version Control with Git 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is a version control software for tracking history and storing changes made to a source code or file while GitHub is basically just a web service/website that pratically provides all of Git's functions with the added benefit of allowing you to host(remotely) and manage your code(Git) for collaboration. So they are not the same thing but they function similarly and go hand and hand.

### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?

I would say the idea of Git is sort of like saving in a video game. It allows you to create save points at any moment as you continue working and making changes. It also keeps a log, which lets you see and jump to these save points that you have made in the past. The way a video game will let you go back to a checkpoint that you have established earlier on and keep all of the progress you have made up until then. GitHub, seems to me to be more like the iCloud service that apple provides. The same way icloud is a place I can send my locally stored photos and share them with others, GitHub hub helps you manage locally stored Git repositories which have been pushed up for collaboration purposes. In that way they are similar.

### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?

I think I will remember the differences between Git and GitHub from now on as they are quite
clear to me already and they will only become more evident as I continue to work with Git/GitHub.

### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

This time I was able to stick to the timebox better. Reading out loud helped.

# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a Git workflow?

Git workflow is a manner in which you use Git to complete work. Usually this means having a workflow that encourages productivity and efficacy. A good workflow also helps you to not get stuck as much, as you have a set of ideal steps you take at specific times. So it's basically the path to accomplish work.

### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

I noticed when I was confused or blocked, it did discourage me for a split second as my inital thought was "this is too complicated". However I also noticed that I learned the best, when I tried it out for myself. Even when it didn't end up working, atleast I knew what not do to. At times when I didn't understand the theory behind it, I just went and gave it a go, which helped me digest it better.

### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?

I would split up my work sessions differently to where I'm always completing a section in one sitting before taking my usual 10 minute break. I think that this will help me keep my mind focused on the topic and understand it better in the end. So basically just divide my working sections 
better.

# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?

Assume I'm working on a project. Stage is basically a location/place all projects must go to before you can commit them. Think of stage as like a lobby to a hotel. So it's sort of like a waiting room before you enter your actual hotel room which in this case would be the commit. The staging area
contains files/projects that will ultimately be in the next commit. Think of it like an intermediate(temporary) phase.

# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?

Main is referring to the main/master branch of the repository. It's the timeline of work where your "main" code(always working) should live.  


### Why create a Branch?

A branch is created to give you a space(copy of the main branch) to make changes, and experiment with these changes without affecting the main code sitting on the "master" branch. This also comes in handy when working collaboratively with GitHub.

### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?  

The basic concept of branching is not hard to understand. However, the actual "how" behind branching through Git is still a little confusing to me. Also the pull/merge concepts still haven't sat well with me and how they work in conjunction with GitHub.

# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?

You would fork when:
 - You want a copy of a foreign repo in your own GitHub account.
 - You want to make changes without affecting the original version.
 - you dont have permission you make changes or contribute to the original version. 
 - you want to use a code as a starting point or foundation to your own project.

### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

No not really. But it does seem to get more familiar as I use fork/pull request more. However I am starting to understand how Git and GitHub work together in a pratical sense, which is exciting.

# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?

I didn't really feel frustrated at any point. The instructions were pretty clear and since we had done something similar with the reflections, it was straight foward. Basically alot of the knowledge I had learned earlier on came together in this challenge.

### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

Looking at some websites we use nowadays, it seems like they are made in some advanced technological lab. They have so many complex features and look so good that it's hard to imagine that they are made the same way I just made this blog. of course this is just the tip of the iceberg. I knew you could make an extremely simply website using HTML but I had no idea how you would actually make it appear on the web. 

# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?

Up until now when I have received a problem that I need to solve, my first step is to try to understand the root cause(understand what is being asked). This may include going back to previous content,lessons or work done. When I have understood it to the best of my abilities, I give it a go myself. However, at times I'm just not able to get a firm grasp on what is being asked or the subject at hand, even after spending time on it. In this case, I give it a go anyways and try to work backwards from there. Sometimes it involves understanding why a solution does not fit. If I get stuck at any point I try to remain relaxed. I try to remember that in almost every case, there is a solution. someone else, somewhere has already dealt with this problem before. I just haven't solved it "yet". This usually allows me to maintain a good headspace while problem solving. This seems to be what is working best for me currently but I'm hoping to encounter ways to enhance and add to my problem solving skills throughout this course.



# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 

Honestly, it wasn't an easy task. This is the first time I remeber having to do something like this. It was definitely somewhat uncomfortable. But once it was done, it felt great. I found myself thinking harder than usual about what I wanted to say about myself and how I wanted to say it. Part of the reason was that I hadn't done this before(also i'm kinda of an introvert) but also because I felt it was important to introduce myself in an authentic(true to myself) way.

### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 

I would say I could feel my ego and was self conscious throughout. I was really trying to look inside into my feelings, thoughts, choices, desires etc.
