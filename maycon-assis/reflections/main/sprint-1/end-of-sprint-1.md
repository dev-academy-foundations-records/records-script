# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?

I would saying keeping a 9-5 working schedule and trying my best to stick to the time box definitely worked for me. I also found myself using youtube at times for a better understanding of certain topics which helped. Keeping a positive mindset at all times. I did feel overwhlemed a couple times with the amount of information I was consuming, wondering if I would be able to remeber everything. I also struggled understanding how to use push/pull/merge at first. 
### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I would say I feel confident. In some more than others. I feel very comfortable working in the command line and with Git but when it comes to GitHub, I'm still a bit lost at times with all the fork/push/pull etc features. But overall I feel as if I have learned alot this week as I am able to do a lot of things I had no idea even existed a week ago. 

### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?

Definitely woking in the command line and VS code because it felt sastifying learning new commands and using them get work done. Learning GitHub was really enjoyable and using it to create my first ever blog was great. Overall just working with all of the new software and tools and learning how to manipuate and use them to my liking was amazing. 

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

I didn't really find anything tedious but if I had to say. It would probably be the Version Control with Git Course as it was long and contained alot of new information but I'm 100% happy with what I learned and took away from it so it was definitely worth the time.

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

At times that I did feel overwhelmed, I would hear "I'm never gonna be able to be good a this". Which did feel real at the time as I was struggling to understand how something worked. I just kept pushing through because I knew that it was only there because of where I was, at the time. On the other hand everytime I would complete a section I wouldn't hear a voice but I would get sort of like a boost in motivation with a feeling that I was doing well and was on track. This was a very good feeling and one that I believed in.
