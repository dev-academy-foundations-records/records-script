# Final Reflections - Sprint Four

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I feel I'm pretty confident in all of the learning competencies. Just need to keep practising Javascript.

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?

Everytime my console.log() gave me what I wanted or anytime I solved a problerm.

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?

I would say getting stuck for long periods of time in the gradebook section definitely did provide this feeling haha.

### How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?

I took a lot of breaks. I did get stuck a lot so these we're really essential. I also continued to do my daily runs/walks.

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say?

I would probably say. "Don't let the blocks get to you. Just keep pushing and eventually you will understand what you need to". Keep going!
