i attempted making the draw game function i found that the hardest but it was nice to figure it out


### What learning(s) are you going to takeaway from this exercise?
that you can do things more than one way and when you are learning do it the way in makes sense in your head and then go back and see f you can improve the code.


# Pair Programming

### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?

I dont I really like the idea I think it makes a lot of sense you should always have someone go over your work regardless, so its good to have an extra set of eyes to help.



### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during Bootcamp? Why so?

im not to sure i think it will be good i love going over ideas with people and seeingwhat they think having another perspective will be a positive.



# Inflate the Unicorn

### Did you learn anything new during this exercise? What was it?

i learnt that if you want to change an image on js and it has a class name instead on and id you need to use a loop to go through every element that has the same calss name otherwise it wont work.




### Did you encounter issues completing any of the steps of this exercise? How did you resolve this?

trying to get the image to change when clicked with javascript was hard but i googled what i needed to do.


### If you were to replace the unicorn with another mystical animal of your choice, what would it be?

a centaur since im a saggitarius


# Whack-a-mole

### What was the hardest part of this exercise?
 probably trying to get the mole to start in a random place and not have it appear in the first cell everytime



### Can you think of any different ways you could have accomplished the same outcome?
i think so i used the create element function in js to create the mole and then appendchild to push the mole on to the body, i think i could have added the mole to the html seperatly.



# Dress the Clown

### How did you find the process of refactoring your code?

Sort of annoying but i enjoyed the challenge but i nthe end it makes the code better


### Would you do anything differently if you were to start this challenge again?

I think  i could make the code smaller if i have time i may go back and try make it better


### What piece of code are you proudest of from this exercise?

probably adding which clothing part you were changing as did it without google


# JS Carnival

### What parts of these challenges did you enjoy? If we were to add more challenges, what would you like to have more of?

I enjoyed dressing the clown i learnt some interesting concepts. you could probably add another challenge but im not sure what


### What parts weren't so good? Were there any parts that you felt stuck on?

the whack a mole one felt quite hard took me a while to figure out how to display the mole in a random place.


### Which parts made you feel confident?

dessing the clown was hard but i manages to figure it out quite fast


### What personally would you want changed to improve the carnival?
