# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?
I think tking time to reflect on the work I have done instead of just jumping on to the next section has helped a lot. I think I have trouble retaining some of the knowledge still but I am going to reflect back through my notes and sprint 1


### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
Im confident after going through the material twice, along with taking notes to read over.



### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?
Honestly I enjoyed all the tech part of sprint 1 its erally interesting seeing what goes on it makes me feel confident for the rest of the course


### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
Probably the Identity, Values, and Strenghs. I find it difficult to talk about myself.


### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
Not really, I think what may have helped is I did learn a little about git and github before starting the course so I felt really confident through most of the sprint.
