# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?

It is the way a developer  can enter commands that your computer will run for you, its like the base of all operations, where we can launch other programs and interact with them. It also lets developers navigate there local system faster and more efficent than clicking through folders on your GUI. It lets you directly send commands to your computer without the use of GUI.

Its like a modified racecar that has all the extra weight taken out of it like seats airbags etc. so it can be as efficent and fast as possible, whilst still maintaining its purpose.



### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

Yes.

### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1. cd - changes the directory you are in
2. pwd - shows the directory you are currently in
3. cd .. - moves you to the parent directory you are currently in
4. touch - makes a new folder, text etc in the directory you are in 
5. mkdir - makes a new directory 


### Did you learn anything unexpected?

Using ls -l and learning what all those letters and numbers are telling you.

# Version Control with Git 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?

Git it a Version Control Software on your local system and doesnt require remote servers for its operation, Github is a website where you can share and collaborate with other developers as it provides file hosting online, it easily allows you to share and manage projects and helps people work together.


### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?

Github is like Youtube, and Git is the content people make.


### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?

Yes.

### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

Yes.

# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a Git workflow?

Git has a lot of flexibility which is great but there is no standard procedure to using git, when working with a team you need to all agree on how to workflow changes throughout the project, everyone should be in agreement on what workflow to use.

### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

I just realised im going way to fast and I would get confused i slowed down and started taking more notes when i got confused or blocked and reflection on the parts I found confusing


### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?

Take it slower and try to understand everything as much as possible before moving on, spend more time reflecting.

# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?

It's like a receptions desk at the library, you put the files there for the librarian to prepare this is staging, and then the librarian files the books back in to the library this is a commit

When you commit its like a save state in a videogame taking a snapshot of the project and that point, where you can come back to later if you find bugs in the code.

# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?

It is the main branch of your project, it should be the working branch and should always be running correctly.

### Why create a Branch

So you can try out new ideas without affecting the main branch, you can commit these changes without merging back into the main branch until its been reviewed by someone else.


### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?  

I would say intuitve you just have to take your time to understand a branch.

# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?

Possibly if you wanted to try adding a new feature to some open source code without affecting the main project.


### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

I was a little confused about how forking was different to cloning. But reading atlassian's post Forking vs Cloning paragraph, helped me understand. Fork repos actually use the git clone command under the hood but git clone is for your local machine and forked clones are for server side clones of official repos.


# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?

Honestly I didnt feel frustrated during this activity, the instructiions are clear and percise, I watched GitHubs video on GitHub Pages to get and understanding of Pages. Along with all we had already learned, creating a repo and cloning to my local machine felt simple.



### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

I had an understanding before joining Devacademy but before then, I thought it was a lot simpler to make websites than it is in reality, there is so much going on under the hood that you dont realize, especially for websites that feel simple and elegant probably have the most going on in the code. I cant wait to get more of an understanding of developing.





# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?
Writing down what is being asked and trying to breakdown what is being asked in to smaller portions so i can understand it better. Instead of just jumping right in making a plan first really helps me. Im not trying to solve one big problem i am breaking it up in to little problems which are easier to manage. then attemping to solve. If that doesnt work reasses and reevaluate what I have done, and try not to get frustrated as coding is logical




# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 

Its really difficult for me Ive never been good with speeches in front of lots of people and I can find it really hard to talk about myself, but im getting more confident



### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 

I supose I did a little bit im pretty aware of my ego but as long as im honest i think my conscious and ego are ok I dont get upset about what other people think of me.
