# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness 

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?
I have always practiced mindfullness on and off, I truly believe in its power to help focus attention, calm the mind, and reduce stress. This section of the course is a good excuse to practice more since I never regret practicing even just for 5 minutes.



### How did you find the overall experience? 
I really enjoy it, Its nice to just give yourself 15minutes to calm the mind and focus of the breath, it makes me feel more focused and helps me learn.



### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness? 
    im going to try and cimmit to 15 minutes in the morning right before i stared working, and also practice after lunvh before working.




# Listening and Looping 

### What was it like to be fully listened to? 
I found it really hard and got a little bit flustered but Tian was really nice and remembered what I had said even though I was a bit all over the place.


### What was it like to fully listen?

It was nice when you try yur hardest to focus on a conversation even though it is only 2 minutes, It can be quite hard to fill in the details but it was nice

    




# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?
I think writing things down during the videos and going over parts i didnt understand again and again really helped 


### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?
I went a bit faster than the timebox suggestions as i felt I understood most of the basics, I think i will go over some of the extra material once i finish the sprint if i have time





# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?
I found it very useful although it was a little confusing at times and had to take my time to try understand everything going on, yes it helped me understand how tehy work together along with HTML


### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?
I realised there is so much to learn it is a little over whelming but when joeseph breaks everything down it makes it easy to understand.
