# Final Reflections - Sprint Three 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
Somewhat confident I think all the new knowledge this week has been  a lot but im slowly understanding.


### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?
probably doing the javascript challenges they were fun to work out and felt nice when you got the answer right


### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?
probably the javascript cafe and loops the video is really good but it feels like a lot to take in. and understanding loops is a challenge


### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?
probably once when i was doing the javascript cafe and i spent 20mins trying to figure out why one part wasnt working and it was just a misspelled word.
