# My Reflections - Sprint Four 

# Code Readability

### What makes code more readable for you?
 Proper indentation, and notes on confusing code to get more of an understanding of what it does


### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?
Spacing


### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?
My workspace is tidy, hopefully my code will be like that!



# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    let expected = 7
    let actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```
### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`: 
```
let sum = (num1, num2) => num1 + num 2
```

### Do you think you would prefer using Test Driven Development? Why?

Because you right the tests before starting the code you dont have to write nice code so as long as it works and passes the test you are on the right track then go back and refactor to make the code readable.



# Kata

### How did you find using repl.it in practice? Confusing? Useful?
we did use repl.it

### Was it helpful to look at the tests while coding the kata?
Very helpful they tell you exactly where is went wrong and helps troubleshooting

### What problem solving techniques did you implement in your coding flow?
I mainly used googling and console.log to help me answers the katas

### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?
implementing fizzbuzz function in to superfizzbuzz

### Did you want to change and refactor your code once you were finished?
not really I should go back and look and see if i can make it better
