# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?
Id say somewhat confident, Ive finished the core work on thursday so I think I will go through some of the material again tommorow and over the weekend



### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?
The freecode camp material as I had done a lot of that material before so it felt good to do it again but easier. I also felt like I really got the concept of HTML and CSS and how they work together and how you link them which has been really enjoyable for me. 



### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?
probably making the css concepts blog as i took mush longer to make the page that the timebox suggested 


### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?
When i was overtime on the CSS concepts i kept talking myself down, saying I wasnt good enough etc I thik it affected me quite a lot I worked some ovvertime for a couple days but now i finished a day early haha.



### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?

Control C + control V haha
I would tell them to check out freecodecamp and try the starting material there to get an understanding of how it works, then learn about git and github
