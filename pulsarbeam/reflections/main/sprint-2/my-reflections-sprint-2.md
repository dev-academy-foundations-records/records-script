# Learn HTML and CSS 

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?
I think the ammount of info that you are given can be pretty over whelming. there is so much to it, but taking time and notes, and time to reflect helps.
I used the pomodoro timing to help give my mind a break. 


### What are of you proud of from this challenge?
Im proud of understadning the concepts of html and css and how they interact together to form a webpage, its so cool having a small understadning of how a website is made.


# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?
I think it's a lot to take in I think I have stenghs in being curious about every part of the video and taking my time to understand what he is talking about. A limitation might be inpatient when I dont understand something I can get frustrated.


### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?
I think I was strugling with the whole video it kind of all blended together but someone in the youtube coments of the video broke the video down in to section which is really nice. I felt I didnt quite understand everything after following the video so I used the additional resources to help understand more.

6 Study related tabs and 2 distraction tabs



### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.




# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  
HTML and CSS need eachother to make a beautiful website, Ill use a home as an analogy HTML is like the framing and structure of the house, you could still ive in it but it wouldnt be that nice, CSS is like the painting, the doors, the carpet, the things you put in the house etc.



### Any moments of surprise or joy? 
I spent almsot 2 hours trying to allign my blog links horizontailly and evenly spaced out on the webpage, I was so happy when i got it.


### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?
ok im gonna use an insect but HTML is like a caterpiller and CSS is a beautiful butterfly because the butterfly needs the not so beautiful caterpiller (beautiful in its own way haha) to exist and do all the work of eating those leaves
