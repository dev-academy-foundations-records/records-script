# Final Reflections - Sprint Five

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?

Understanding javascript.

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?

A lot of the core stuff. I just struggle to write about myself

### Was Foundations what you expected it to be like? If not, what was different?

Yes.

### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?

I wanted to give up on writing the Core blog posts a lot. I found if I wrote a story to convey the concepts instead of trying to just explain what they were, it became easier.

### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?

I feel prepared. I am concerned about waking up on time.

### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?

Happy birthday!

### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?

No. I feel like I have to have a job first.
