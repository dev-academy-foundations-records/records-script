# Final Reflections - Sprint Three

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

Very.

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?

I liked all the javascript exercises. It was fun pausing the video and trying to solve the JS Cafe thing myself before watching the video and see if I did it the same way.

### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?

I wasn't angry but I got bit writers block-ish when trying to do the Emotional Intelligence blog post. I know what it is and I think it's super important, but I just found it difficult to actually describe it.

### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?

I got frustrated with the JS Cafe thing at some points but that was because I did it in different ways and didn't plan ahead enough. When I realised you were supposed to add another button I kind of gave up because my one button already did the things, and in order to introduce another one I'd have to change a lot of stuff.
