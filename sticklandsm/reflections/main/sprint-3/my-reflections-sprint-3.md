# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

Explained this in my What I expect from the Facilitation team part of my blog:

I understand that mindfulness and mindful listening exercises are good and helpful to most nuerotypical people. I have been pressured to try the practice on many different occasions and frankly it only makes things worse for me. It's stressful at the best of times and outright panic attack inducing at the worst. When I try to make this clear to people they then usually respond that nobody's good at it at first, and it just takes practice and it's hard but totally worth it. I know they're just trying to help, but in my opinion it's pretty ableist to just assume everyones mind works the same, and that everyone will benifit from this very specific practice that tries to make you do all the things that you've been diagnosed as having difficulty doing. To be told that it's just because I didn't try hard enough to do it is infuriating.

### How did you find the overall experience?

I've tried it 5 or 6 times before. It's not fun for me. I've heard a lot of meditation is focusing on breathing, or the inside of your hands or just the moment in general and just trying to notice when you're not doing that anymore. Then not getting angry when you get distracted but just noticing it and then get back to focusing on the breathing. I think maybe the reason I dislike this process so much is because this is very close to how I do anything that requires focus.

### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness?

I'll get my meditation quota through other means. I go for walks a fair bit with a podcast.

# Listening and Looping

### What was it like to be fully listened to?

I'm not taking part in these exercises due to mindfullness not suiting my learning style/lifestyle

# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?

Before this course I did a decent amount of the stuff at learnjavascript.online so this was very easy for me. It was very nice not having to watch all the videos and pretty much jumping straight into the coding. I learned about switch cases and ternary operators too which was nice. When I learned this stuff previously, learning by doing worked for me.

### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?

Yes, I finished this very quickly. I've added some of the recommended reading to my ereader and will be looking over that when I get bored.

# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?

It was fun. I tried to do the task on my own instead of just copying what the video was saying. I did pretty well except I forgot I was supposed to add a fill customer order button so my generate customer button did all of the things.

### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?

I learned that you can't put variables into object dot notation, you have to use the square brackets. That took me a long time to figure out.
