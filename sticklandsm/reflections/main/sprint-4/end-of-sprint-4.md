# Final Reflections - Sprint Four

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

Very

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?

Doing the Kata stuff.

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?

I found it difficult writing about Neuroplasticity.

### How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?

I took Monday off. Started super late on Thursday and will likely take Friday off too.

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say?

Just do the code stuff that you like first and do the Neuroplasticity stuff last.
