# My Reflections - Sprint One

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?

CMD Line is a way of interacting with a file system through text rather than using a GUI. Kind of like drawing things by hand instead of photoshop. Photoshop is sort of easier but you don't have the same freedom, or power.

### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

Yes. I did it well within the time because I was vaguely familiar with cmd stuff already.

### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1. rm - remove file
2. rmdir remove directory
3. cd change directory
4. touch - make file
5. code - open file in VSCode

### Did you learn anything unexpected?

I learned my printer isn't working since nothing happened when I tried to print the cheat sheet.

# Version Control with Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is the program installed on computers which allows version control. For example it allows computers to clone local copies of code, make edits, then send the code back up to its central depository. Github is the central depository where the code is stored, copied from, and coppied back to.

### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?

Git is the CostCo card, GitHub is the CostCo warehouse. I guess Git would more be the car you use to get there and the roads, and the trolley, and the credit card, and the entire concept of shopping. It's not a perfect metaphor.

### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?

Yes.

### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

Yes but I took longer than I thought I would because I got distracted trying to come up with a better metaphor for Git and Github.

# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a Git workflow?

I don't remember this being mentioned in the course I just watched. From google I can see it's the way different companies use git to commit and merge code. Right now I would say that is the process of editing > Adding > Committing code.

### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

For some reason I could concentrate better when I had the course info squidged into the left half of my laptop display. I did that so I could have both the terminal and web browser open. I guess because it made it word wrap, it tricks my brain into thinking there's less information. I didn't really get blocked, a part from getting distracted a lot (Severe ADHD and meds for that wearing off). I took a break when that kept happening, and kept myself medicated. That helped.

### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?

Change the browser to display on half screen earlier.

# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?

Its like an airlock on a spaceship. But for code.

# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?

The main branch of code is the most stable code, like the current release.

### Why create a Branch?

So that changes made don't affect the main branch until they're fully tested/stable

### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?

It makes sense but I wouldn't exactly say it's intuitive, because I'm not use to working exclusively with the cmd line.

# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?

When you want to try making changes to code without changing the main branch.
If you don't have edit access to the main repo, but want to try some things.

### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

Not particularly. It all makes sense so far.

# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?

I found this quite easy. I didn't get frustrated.

### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

I didn't know you could host a website on GitHub so easily. That was cool.

# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?

Break thing down into smaller steps, and work out the relationship between those steps (What passes input, output to what). Write things out on the whiteboard if it gets confusing. Make sure you know what each step should be doing so that you can test that it works before moving on to coding the next step. Comment on the code, but also try to make the code readable so that it kinda makes sense even without the comments.

If I get stuck try rubberducking. If I need to, google it.

# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?

Stressful. I don't like talking about myself. Reminds me of job interviews which I dislike.

### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?

Yes. I didn't want to say something too try hard but also didn't want to say something stupid.
