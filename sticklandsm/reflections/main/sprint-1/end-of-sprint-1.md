# Final Reflections - Sprint One

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?

I'm not use to self motivated study from home so my goal was to just work normal business hours. I woke up at 9 on the first day so that wasn't ideal but I got to working around 10 and finished at 7 so I kept the right hours at least. Today I have worked from 8:30 to 6ish so that's good for me.

I faced problems with getting back to work after lunch.

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

Quite confident. I'm going to go back and review though.

### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?

Learning about Git and GitHub, which I didn't know much about

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

The core task "Identity, Values, and Strengths" I didn't know what I was actually supposed to be doing really. I've just written a massive blog post going over my values and stuff and saved it to my desktop but I'm not sure if that was right.

This isn't really a problem. I just like to have explicit instructions if i'm meant to do something which I know isn't always possible/helpful.

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

At the start when I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to be starting on, that freaked me out. But eventually I think I got it.

I found this all pretty easy, which means I'm worried that I've done completely the wrong thing entirely.
