# My Reflections - Sprint Two

# Your Blog

### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?

I created a new folder for the blog, then created an html file from a template provided. I then linked a black CSS file to that html template

### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?

I've found them helpful to know where I should be up to, however I'm not stressing too much about sticking to them/going too fast. I used to get super stressed if I was ahead/didn't have anything to do because I thought it meant I wasn't studying hard enough. Through reflection I've learned that's not necessarily true though.

# Learn HTML and CSS

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?

I found it very difficult to keep focus the past couple of days, which made the FreeCodeCamp courses take much longer than expected. I didn't find those particularly hard, I just kept getting distracted by other things going on. I ran into some trouble with the "Be able to navigate the DOM" learning objective. I just fundamentally did not understand what the task meant, and I got more confused and frustrated the more I looked into it. From my understanding the DOM is kind of like an interface that web browsers look at HTML through so that other langauges like Javascript can access and change things. But the idea of being able to navigate the DOM confused me because I thought it was a step in between that we're not supposed to see. To my understanding it was kind of like being asked to navigate the semantic analysis of a compiled langauge while it's being compiled. This made me think I must not understand what a DOM. Anyway I talked to my partner about it who's a senior engineer and they explained I was probably way overthinking it, and by "navigate" it likely just means understand what it is and why it is.

### What are of you proud of from this challenge?

I am proud that I got through it despite my distractins and frustrations, and now understand what the DOM is (hopefully) . I'm probably never going to trust people named Dominic now.

# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?

I am not great at watching long tutorials like this, it took me longer than expected to finish the video. I had to rewind quite a lot because I found myself getting distracted and thinking about other things.

### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?

I kept getting distracted during the last 5 minutes of the crash course, so I took a break and came back to it after lunch.

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

I have 13 tabs open. 3 of them aren't study related. I had some shopping ones open but I closed them when I started this reflection.

### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.

Yes. Went to a shopping website and replaced the word Flip Flops with Jandels.

# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.

There once was a boy called called HTML, he thought eveyone hated him because he was so awful to look at. One day while surfing the internet, HTML came across the Brazilian rock band 'Cansei de Ser Sexy'. He became obsessed with the band immediately, and eventually changed his whole style to be based around them. He finally felt whole. Unfortunately HTML found that people still hated being around him. He failed to realise that changing your style doesn't cover up the ugliness inside. Only Javascript can do that, but Javascript is not also the name of a band so the metaphor dies here. Just like poor HTML. Cold and alone, clutching CSS's one good album.

### Any moments of surprise or joy?

I sat trying to figure out CSS Flex boxes for about 5 hours today. I didn't realise how much time had passed and I was enjoying it. That was surprising. It wassurprisingly difficult though, I still haven't wrapped my head around it.

### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?

HTML is a chicken. Very ordinary but you can use it to do basic tasks like eating chicken, and training to fight Apollo Creed. CSS is a peacock, it's kind of pointless on it's own but you can pluck it's feathers and fashion a peacock costume for the chicken to wear.
