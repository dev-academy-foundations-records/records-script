# Final Reflections - Sprint Two

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?

I'm confident in everything except Flex boxes which I still find very confusing. I probably just need to look at some diagrams.

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?

It was very satisfying doing the layout of the blog.

### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?

I had bad mental heath days on monday and tuesday, which resulted in not much work getting done. This made me anxious the following days about being behind. I've caught up now though.
Also the flex boxes.

### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?

The voice is surprisingly contained so far.

### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?

Draw it on a whiteboard, Start with the bones html, then add to it from there. In reality I would be concerned they were about to pitch me an idea for an app or something so I would probably say I didn't know.
