        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
      </h3>
      <p>
        This has remained the same. I want to become a software developer and
        get a job to progress my skills further. Eventually, I want ot be able
        to use my skills to create software/programs/websites etc to be used by
        teachers within schools to better the engagement of students.

      <h3 class="question">
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Self-Disciple won't really show too much here because I will be around
        others and I will have to stay focused, no dogs to just randomly go play
        with. I know that we will be working with others and I feel tact might
        be a weakness for me. If I don't agree with someones idea, I can be
        quite stubborn, but by working in a group, I'm going to have to learn to
        accept others' point's of view. I will also struggle with receiving
        feedback, as I often take it personally and really beat myself up over
        it.

      <h3 class="question">
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Basically as mentioned about, giving feedback tactfully. I responding to
        feedback as a positive rather than criticism.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <h3 class="question">
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Taking feedback as a positive rather than as critisism. Giving equal
        opportunity for sharing ideas, and listening to others share.(I can
        sometimes have quite a strong personality)
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <h3 class="question">
        What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
      </h3>
      <p>
        This remains very similar. I expect clear communication and feedback to
        help if I am on the wrong path. If I do not meet the expectations the
        Boot camp team have of me, I would expect to be approached so that I can
        correct what I am doing wrong.

      </p>
      <h3 class="question">
        What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
      </h3>
      <p>
        That I will go to sleep at a normal hour to ensure I am present and
        alert for boot camp. That I will put in the mahi and ask questions when
        I need help. That I will help others when I can. That I will be prepared
        and meet deadline. That I will do what I have said I would do.

      <h3 class="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        That is a great question. I have switched careers/ jobs a few times in
        my life already. My aim now is to become a software developer and get a
        job to progress my skills further. Eventually, I want ot be able to use
        my skills to create software/programs/websites etc to be used my
        teachers within schools to better the engagement of students

        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        I work hard and I can keep working on things that I find a challenge
        without giving up. But I can often get distracted by little things that
        aren't a priority. I can be quite self-critical and I lack self-disciple
        and organisation.

      <h3 class="question">
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Self-Disciple in terms of staying on task and getting things done in a
        timely manner. Organisational and time management skills.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <h3 class="question">
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:

        <ol>
          <li>
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
            and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
            representatives
            <br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
            you
          </li>
        </ol>
      </h3>
      <p>
        I have been using toggl and the time boxes to help with time management.
        I take regular breaks approxamitely every 2 hours. I make sure I have
        water on hand and I get excercise everyday,too. I plan out my week on
        the Monday morning to allocate time for everything and just to make sure
        other commits do not interfere with my studies.

        <br />
      </p>
      <h3 class="question">
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am pretty good at asking for help when I need it. I usually try the
        problem myself, then google, then check the forums, then ask for help
        and then ask the facillator for help. I try get all my work done Monday
        to Friday, so that I know there will be someone available if I get
        really stuck.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <h3 class="question">
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      </h3>
      <p>
        Clear communication, feedback, tips and tricks, guidance to solve
        problems rather than give me the answers.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <h3 class="question">
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I'm pretty lucky not to have any fixed commitments. I take time to spend
        with my family and friends but this is all flexible.
