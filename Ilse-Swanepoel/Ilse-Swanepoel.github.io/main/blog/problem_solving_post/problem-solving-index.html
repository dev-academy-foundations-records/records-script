      <h2 class="subheading">A Simple Problem - A not so simple solution</h2>
      <br />
      <h3 class="questionx">What was the problem?</h3>
      <p>
        Trying to think about a time I was stuck on a simple problem is actually
        really hard. I know I've been in that position multiple times, but I
        guess my brain decides we don't need to remember the specific problem,
        just the lessons learnt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I encountered an error where my code just wouldn't work. I
        spent hours trying to figure out why, turns out I just had an extra
        semi-colon. It was extremely frustrating, because I began doubting my
        capabilites and understanding.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3 class="questionx">What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      <p>
        I began by reading the problem over and over again. Looked at my
        pseudocode, looked at my code. It all seemed to make sense, but just
        wouldn't work. So I decided to try different methods. I wrote more
        Pseudocode and more matching code and figured out 3 different ways the
        coding challenge could be solved. BUT NONE OF IT WORKED. I googled, I
        went onto the discord chat to see if anyone else had encountered an
        issue with the challenge. Nothing. Eventually I reached out to Jared,
        and he went through some of the coding with me, within the first couple
        of minutes, I noticed it was just an extra semi-colon.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="questionx">How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p>
        When I get stuck on something simple, I always feel extremely
        frustrated. This often bothers me more than a complex problem, simply
        because I feel like it should not take me that long to figure it out.
        When it is a simple problem, it is always harder to ask for help,too. I
        don't want someone to be like "Omg, how do you not know this!". So
        really the main feelings are frustrated and embarrassed.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, when I found out it was just an extra semi-colon I was truely
        relieved. I had understood the problem, just made a small mistake.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3 class="questionx">What did you learn?</h3>
      <p>
        Taking breaks often and attention to detail is key. Proof read your code
        as if you were proof reading an important email.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2 class="subheading">Elegant Problem-Solving</h2>
      <br />
      <h3 class="questionx">What was the problem?</h3>
      <p>
        So this is a non-coding example, but a problem that I put a lot of
        effort and research into solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my family, we love board games. For the past year, we have been
        playing one called Wingspan every Friday night. Unfortunately, the bird
        feeder supplied is made out of card board and is starting to break.
        Knowing that this game is one we will continue to play for a long time,
        I wanted to make a new bird feeder. I have NO experience with wood work
        or craft like this, so it was quite an ambitious undertaking
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="questionx">What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      <p>
        I used google, to look at examples of what other people had made. I
        decided I wanted to try pyrography to add detail and decoration to my
        birdfeeder. So I researched the best wood for pyrography and the best
        wood for craft and I drew out a basic design of what I wanted and the
        pieces I would need. Then I found a really thin plywood online that
        seemed to fit what I needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then called one of my friends(who does wood work as a hobby) to check
        if I was on the right track. Once I confirmed that the ply wood should
        work for the job, I drew out a measured template of all the pieces. I
        used the original bird feeder as a guide. This allowed me to calculate
        how much plywood I would need.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the building process, I would ask my dad and my friend for
        advice when I encountered issues but before asking for their input, I
        would explain my thoughts first. They could then refine my ideas or
        explain why it wouldn't work.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3 class="questionx">How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p>
        Even though the end result was not perfect, I feel very proud of what I
        achieved. I felt optomistic the whole way through. It wasn't a project
        that was a life or death situation. If I got it wrong, it didn't matter.
        Having a plan ready to go and also to refer back to throughout the
        process was really good. I think the thing that made the most difference
        was knowing that there were people I could ask for help at any point.
        People who were happy to help and had a wealth of knowledge and
        expertise.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="questionx">What did you learn?</h3>
      <p>
        I learnt soooooo much. Not just about wood work but about the importance
        of planning and patience and thinking things through carefully. The
        project took me about 4 weeks and knowing that I stuck to a project for
        that long and finished it, is something I will always be proud of.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 class="subheading">Problem-Solving Techniques</h2>
      <br />
      <h3 class="questionx">Pseudocode</h3>
      <p>
        100%. This is so important to me along with commenting. It's almost like
        drawing out a plan of what you need to do. It allows you to break the
        problem into smaller chunks and work on one piece at a time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="questionx">Try Something</h3>
      <p>
        Again, this is extremely important. If you are stuck, just try
        SOMETHING. It doesn't matter if it doesn't work. Using this along with
        console logging and error messages can help you rule out some solutions.
        You can't solve a problem if you don't do anything.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="questionx">Rubber Ducky Method</h3>
      <p>
        I had honestly never heard about this method before this week, but it
        makes sense. I don't know if it is one I would use much personally, but
        I do understand the importance of being able to explain what you are
        doing and why. I just prefer to do this with real people.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="questionx">Reading Error Messages</h3>
      <p>
        This one is taking some getting used to. I do use the error messages to
        show me which line and what the problem is. Usually it says unexpected
        or expected ( ; etc. Sometimes it shows I haven't declared a variable
        properly and says undefined. So I am getting more comfortable using
        error messages for the basics, but I know this will be an essential tool
        for more complex errors too.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="questionx">Console Logging</h3>
      <p>
        This one has also taken a bit of getting used to, but I use it a lot
        now. It is great for testing short bits of code.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="questionx">Googling</h3>
      <p>
        Google has been my best friend. Especially for little things, that I
        vaguely remember, but can't remember specific details for. I usually
        skim through the stuff to see what looks familiar and go from there. It
        is also great for learning new things, but I make sure that it builds on
        concepts I already know, so that it isn't too out of my depth.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="questionx">Asking your peers for help</h3>
      <p>
        Rather than ask directly, I tend to look at previous posts and see if
        anyone had a similar problem. If no-one has posted, I will usually ask
        my homegroup first and then post on discord.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="questionx">Asking coaches for help</h3>
      <p>
        I try to leave this as a last resort. If I can't explain the problem I
        am having, just that I am having trouble, I will probably reach out to a
        facilitator rather than a peer. The facillitators are absolutely
        approachable, don't get me wrong, but I feel that in a course like this,
        it is better to ask peers as it also gives them a chance to solidify
        their learning.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="questionx">Improving your process with reflection</h3>
      <p>
        I reflect a lot on what went well, what could have been differently and
        what I would do next time. My thought process is becoming more apparent
        through my coding comments. This would not be done in the same manner if
        it was a shared project, but for my own reference, I am finding this
        very useful for the challenges I do on my own.
