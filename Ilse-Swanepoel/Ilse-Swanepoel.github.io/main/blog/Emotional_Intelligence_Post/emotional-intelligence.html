  <h3 class="question">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
  <p>
  “Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to perceive, interpret, demonstrate, control, and use emotions to communicate with and relate to others effectively and constructively. This ability to express and control emotions is essential, but so is the ability to understand, interpret, and respond to the emotions of others.”1

<p>
Essentially, EQ is understanding your own thoughts and feelings, as well as those of others.
</p>

<p>
People are extremely complex, with complex emotions and needs. So, as a way to break down a complex and abstract concept such as EQ, I will use an analogy (because I always find them helpful, maybe you will too). Think of the ocean, in whatever form you like. Maybe it’s grey and rough with lots of waves or maybe it's shimmering and calm in the sunlight, like a mirror.  That surface, is a person’s outward emotion, what we see. Maybe they are angry, maybe they are calm. Understanding what their emotion is, is only one part though. But what is causing this emotion? What is going on underneath those powerful waves, or that shimmering light?
</p>

<p>
Knowing that what you see on the surface and what is going on underneath can be totally different and can be different from person to person is part of EQ.

  <h3 class="question">How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
<p>In teaching, we often asked students questions about a text to see how much they understood from reading. The 2 main types were literal and inferential questions. Literal questions would be questions you can find in the text and inferential questions were a “read between the lines” type deal. Literal questions (IQ) could be answered by looking at the book. For example, what is Billy doing? “He is reading.” Inferential questions (EQ) were more complex and the children often referred to them as thinking questions. They had to look at different clues and figure out what was going. For example, how does Billy feel about reading? How do you know? “He hates it, look at his face. He looks grumpy and it says he sighed maybe he wants to go and do something else”. 
  </p>

  <p>
  To me this perfectly sums up IQ and EQ. IQ can be found in a book, and EQ requires understanding of people, their feelings and putting yourself in their shoes.
<br>
<br>  
<br>
</p>

  <h3 class="question">Why is EQ important?</h3>
  <p>As mentioned previously, IQ can be found in a book. These days with google and such easy access to knowledge, IQ is becoming less important than before. EQ, understanding the needs of others, and how to help them effectively in a way that works for them, is much more important. Being able to work with others and draw on their knowledge and skills through strong relationships is a much more valuable skill than simply googling (which anyone can do).
