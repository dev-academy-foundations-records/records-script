      <h3 class="question">
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h3>
      <p>
        There are so many ethical decisions we need to make throughout our life
        time. Sometimes we will look back at these and regret the decision we
        made, other times, these decisions will help define who we become. When
        ever I come across a decision I need to make, I turn the question back
        to me and who I want to be. I let kindness drive my decisions. Is it
        always the correct way to do it? No, it can bring the consequence of
        being taken advantage of, and can lead you to believe that others also
        act with the base value of kindness, even though this may not be the
        case. I do try and believe that all humans are inately kind and that
        other unkind acts come from survival and trauma instincts.

        A couple of years ago, I had a student approach me. He was not my
        student but many of his friends were in my class. He came to me and said
        he was very hungry and had eaten his lunch in the morning becuase he had
        no breakfast. I told him we could call his mum to get some extra food
        brought for him. He was adamant that his mum would get angry and he
        would get in trouble. I then said we could call the office and organise
        some sandwiches and he said no, last time they did that they called his
        mum to let her know and he got into lots of trouble. For me, school was
        always meant to be a safe space for these children, where they can come
        to you with problems without fear of getting into trouble. I called the
        office and requested sandwiches, I asked them not to contact the family
        on this occasion but instead we would make a note to keep track of
        whether this occurs again or not. This meant that if neglect etc was
        happening at home, we could track it, and taking the neccessary steps,
        but that in the meantime, this boy could continue learning, continue
        feeling safe and feel his decisions were respected. Kindness and respect
        often overlap for me.

      <h3 class="question">
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I believe the biggest influence for who I am today, is my parents. They
        left behind a wealthy life in South Africa to move here with barely any
        money, no jobs, no family, no friends. They both worked incredibly hard
        to get to where they are today and are very generous and kind people.
        The sacrifice they made encourages me to see the beauty of New Zealand
        around me, everyday. To appreciate the freedom and opportunities that
        have been given to me. As a result, I am a really hard worker and I try
        my best in everything I do, no matter how small. The kindness my parents
        have shown to others has shown me how this impacts your fulfullness in
        life. I have also seen them turn around from an extrememly racist and
        unkind society, to being accepting of different cultures and belief.
        This kindness and respct has surrounded me my entire life and I try hard
        to project this from my own being.

      <h3 class="question">
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h3>
      <p>
        The strengths that will support me on this journey, are my work ethic
        and drive to better myself. My curiosity and life long love of learning,
        will help me to stay comitted. My kindness and ability to work with
        others will potentially help others to stay committed and succeed in
        this course too.

      <h3 class="question">
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h3>
      <p>
        My limitation, especially my lack of organisation skills could be my
        downfall. This is especially true in Foundations where there is no one
        to keep me accountable all of it needs to be self-driven and effeciently
        managed. That said I was well aware of this limitation when taking on
        this challenge so it is something I already have plans in place for.
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <h3 class="question">
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h3>
      <p>
        When there is tension between a group, I often work to ensure everyone
        has the same goal in mind. Often, people have the same goals, but
        different ways they want to go about it. Communication needs to be clear
        and we need to be on the same page. One thing that is essential when
        working with others, is knowing you can't always have your way, even if
        you whole-heartedly believe your way is better. Leading by example is
        often a way to get others on board, especially if you have already built
        that repoir with them. I have often used the line "While I continue to
        see this differently to you, I am willing to support you in your
        decision as I know we have the same goal in mind - this was usually the
        wellbeing of the students in my class or something similar. You have to
        pick your battles. It is also essential to have someone who at the end
        of the day , will make the final call. Colaboration is important but it
        needs to be balanced with some kind of hierachy, even if this means to
        collaborators seek and expert opinion and go with that advice.
