      <h3 class="question">
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        1. I have learnt to be content in my own presence. Usually I require
        people around me to talk to, bounce ideas off etc but as foundations has
        progressed, I found less of a need to be around people, and I have
        become more comfortable with my own presence.
        <br />
        2. Changing habits is extremely hard, even if you do have the
        motivation. I have found it extrememly difficult to stick to any sort of
        routine, and I know I am going to struggle with that once we start
        bootcamp.
        <br />
        3. I am a lot more capable than I give myself credit for. I was
        expecting massive meltdowns from finding things hard, but I have found
        that I have a lot more resilience than I ever thought.

      <h3 class="question">
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Values for everyone will be different. Empathy in understanding that
        everyone is different. Some of us will prefer to work alone, in silence,
        others would rather have some buzzing discussions around. So
        understanding what everyone values and not pushing your values on them
        will be a part of empathy. Self-awareness- When you are struggling, you
        need to be aware so you can help yourself before you spiral. Knowing
        yourself will help prevent burn out.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="question">
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We never learnt these skills in high school or uni. Yet they are
        essential, makes me grateful that I chose Dev Academy to study with.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="question">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Often, it can feel a bit rushed, just because you spend so much time on
        the programming, that core sometimes feels like you have run out of
        steam.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="question">
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I have mentioned previously in my blog posts how important I believe
        these core/human skills are. Unfortunately, education in this space has
        been lacking for so long that many people don't understand the concepts
        of neuroplasticity, emotional intelligence, self-awareness etc. The
        understanding and practise of these skills is essential in life, but
        vital to something as challenging as coding. Dev Academy has made a
        great choice by teaching core skills alongside tech skills. We will
        certainly be more well-rounded programmers as a result.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="question">
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h3>
      <p>
        No, 100% it has not been a waste of time. Even though I have been
        exposed to many of the core concepts previously, refreshers and further
        learning are always beneficial. These skills are essential so definitely
        not a waste of time.
