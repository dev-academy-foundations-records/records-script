      <h3 class="question">What is Neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the idea that the brain is like a muscle. We can
        improve neuro pathways by repeating actions or thoughts, just as the
        neuropath ways would diminish if the actions weren't done for a long
        time. The neuroscience behind it gets a little bit more complex but
        involves the outside of the neurons being myelinated. The myelin sheath
        acts almost as insulation, the thicker the myelin, the faster the
        transmission of electrical signals. Neuroscientific studies have shown
        that this myelin sheath thickness increases as we repeat thoughts and
        actions.

      <h3 class="question">So who is Mojo and what is a Growth Mindset?</h3>
      <p>
        As a primary school teacher, I spent a lot of time teaching students
        about Growth mindest vs Fixed mindset as well as "The Power of Yet".
        Mojo is a character from some clips that I came across to help me teach
        this message. While as an adult, the clips may seem "baby-ish", the
        message behind them are clear and powerful. If you have not seen these
        clips before, take the time to watch the first one now, it is a great
        explanation of hoe the brain is like a muscle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a growth mindset is simply having the belief that you can learn.
        Just because you can't do it yet, doesn't mean you won't be able to in
        future. The opposite is true for a Fixed Mindset. This is the belief
        that some people are born smart, and others aren't. That no matter how
        hard you work you won't be able to learn the new skill. Obviously,
        having a growth mindset has a positive impact on learning.

      <h3 class="question">The Learning Pit?</h3>
      <p>
        Another concept I would explore with my students every year was "The
        Learning Pit". It closely ties into Growth Mindset and discusses that it
        is okay to find things hard, we just need to know some stratergies to
        get "unstuck". Every challenge we face, helps our brain to grow.
