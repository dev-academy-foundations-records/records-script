      <h3 class="question">HTML, CSS and JS</h3>
      <p>
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript all work together to make a functioning,
        beautiful and interactive webpage. HTML includes the structure and
        content. CSS includes the design and visual aspects of the webpage.
        JavaScript includes interactivity such as buttons and animations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Analogy time again. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are like a car. HTML is the
        structure, the chassis, of the car. CSS is the interior and exterior
        look, the design, of the car. JavaScript is what makes it GO. You push
        the accelerator and the car moves forwards, you turn the steering wheel,
        and the car turns.

      <h3 class="question">Control flow and loops</h3>
      <p>
        Code is usually read from top to bottom, and the actions are excuted in
        that order. For example, if you were a waitress at a cafe. You might go
        through the following events in order:
      </p>
      <p>
      <ol class="js-list">
        <li>Greet guests</li>
        <li>Show them to their table</li>
        <li>Bring the guests some water</li>
        <li>Take order</li>
        <li>Bring their order</li>
        <li>Clear plates</li>
        <li>Take dessert order</li>
        <li>Bring them their dessert order</li>
        <li>Clear their plates</li>
        <li>Take payment</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    
      <p>
      In most cases, this order of events would work just fine but say our
      customers didn't want desserts? As humans, we would adjust what we do
      next. The same goes for the computer if we use loops to alter our control
      flow. If we simply followed the instructions 7-9, things would get awkward
      pretty quickly for customers who did not want dessert. Instead, we could
      use the loop if cutomers want dessert, bring dessert, else bring the
      check. Loops allow us to create conditions and alternatives to the
      original instructions.

      <h3 class="question">Arrays and Objects</h3>
      
      <p><b>Arrays</b></p>
      <p>
        Arrays hold a collection of data. For example, it could be a list of chocolate flavours where the chocolate flavours are the items in an array.
      </p>
      <br>
      <img
        class="long-image"
        src="/../blog/js_fundamentals/Chocolate-Array.png"
      />

      <p><b>Objects</b></p>
      <p>
        Objects are similar, where they can hold a collection of data, but objects contain data about a specific item, in this instance, the nutritional value of the specific chocolate flavour.
      </p>
      <br>
      <img
        class="js-image"
        src="/../blog/js_fundamentals/Nutritional-Information.png"
      />
      
      <br />
      <h3 class="question">Functions and why they matter</h3>
      <p>
        A function is a very helpful tool. It allows us to <em>teach</em> the
        computer to do something, and then when we give the command at any
        point, it will do what we asked it to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if we wanted to teach a dog to do a trick, we wouldn't want
        the dog to do the trick all the time, only when you give the command. So
        you teach the dog what to do when you call the command, so that if they
        ever hear the command, the do what they have been taught. The same goes
        for the computer, once a function has been programmed, whenever you call
        that function, the computer will do the actions that were programmed.

      <h3 class="question">The DOM and DevTools</h3>
      <p>
        This time, we are going to use the analogy of a clothing store. Thing
        about your favourite physical clothing store. We have the clothing(HTML
        content), catogorised in some shape or form (HTML structure). Maybe an
        area for jackets, shoes, accessories, T-shirts, etc. We have the layout,
        where everything is put, how wide the aisles are, the posters and
        signage. This is our CSS. Then our workers, who can order new stock,
        greet customers, they are our JavaScript.
      </p>
      <br />
      <img
        class="js-image"
        src="/../blog/js_fundamentals/clothing-store-layout.png"
      />
      <p>
        The DOM, well the DOM is the actual store. It contains everything, the
        clothes, the customers, the signs. DevTools are what allow us, as the
        CEO (developers) to change what ever we want about the store. Maybe we
        want to find a particular item of clothing: A green dress in size XL. We
        would look in the clothes area (HTML - which is accessed by using
        .document) and we would look in the dress area, followed by the green
        dresses, followed by our size. By finding our piece of clothing, we
        could then change it's price, order more, put it on sale etc
      </p>
      <p>
        Using DevTools to find this piece of clothing would look something like
        this
        <br />
        <br />
        .clothes.dresses.green-dresses.XL-size
