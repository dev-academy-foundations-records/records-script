# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?

70% confident for the CSS part while learning through this sprint as there are still a lot of things to learn.
I will keep researching about each of them throughout this course and get used to it.

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?

Building skeleton structures using HTML was what I felt capable however it stills needs more improvement for better design.

### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?

Designing the HTML structures with CSS to satisfy my planned design was the part where I felt anxious due to lack of knowledge.
More studies need to be done for this part.

### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?

More studies and more practices were what my voice told me, it affected me quite critical to practice them more.

### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?

Basically there are three languages required to make a website, HTML,CSS and Javascript. 
I would describe each of them as below.

HTML: Building up a basic structure of website like a skeleton.
CSS: Design the structure you made with colors, layout and even some awesome fonts.
Javascript: Make your website more dynamic with some animations or whatever you like.
