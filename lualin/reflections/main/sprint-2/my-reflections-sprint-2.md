### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?

It took less than the stated timebox as I know this part quite familiar.
Some useful tools like live html viewer have been used for faster workflow.

# Learn HTML and CSS 

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?

While learning the basic html/css courses, I was not fully understood about few CSS attributes such as display, position.
So I had to spend more time to research and study about them via Google search and some Youtube videos. 


### What are of you proud of from this challenge?

Getting to know deeper about CSS by understanding better of its attributes to put items in a way as expected.
There were actually several things that I was not really clear about such as display, position, animation and etc.


# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?

I learnt to how to use the developer tool in browser efficiently by checking values of each component in website. So I could figure out to set values of each component for all things to be well organised. 

### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?

Not really blocked at somewhere as I could understand how this tool works like by browsing the tool one by one.

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

About 10 open now and all related to DevTool and detailed info about padding, margin in CSS.


### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.

I just tried editing the figures in my bank account :) hope I had that money.


# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  

Firstly, I was trying to make a neat website in warm colors inspired by a flower picture of mine. Chose my own color pallete based on the photo and the components inside should also match the chosen color pallete for consistent design flow. But my imagination was way too far from my skill. Quite hard to design the website as the way I expected. 

### Any moments of surprise or joy? 

If my CSS codes worked the way as I expected, it was quite joyful that will not last long until I edit them later.


### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?

I would say that HTML is like a dog while CSS is a cat. 
As a dog normally follows people well like structuring a website with HTML isn't normally a big deal.
However when it comes to CSS where I descibed it as a cat, I would not easily understand how it is working like and where it is heading to.
