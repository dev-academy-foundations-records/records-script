# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness 

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

I had a bias about this concept that it is kind of way to reach the enlightenment through meditation or else however it actually meant to be more practical in our daily life, mental health, psychological effect and many others recently.


### How did you find the overall experience? 

Through some researches about mindfulness, I have got to understand that mindfulness can be very useful in our overall life via numerous outcomes of it. Such as:

1. Reflect inside of my mind to see the whole of myself.
2. Consciously put aside the thoughts that constantly come to mind for a while and focus fully on me. Focusing on me here and now.
3. By focusing completely on myself now, cut off the numerous unnecessary signals from the outside and the distracting thoughts that come out of my head.
4. Take a step back from a stressful situation,
5. Get out of the habit of reacting automatically.
6. Get rid of the useless worries and thoughts floating around head, find the real problem, and focus on it.
7. Change mind comfortably and positively.
8. Inspiration comes and creative ideas come up by cleaning up the unneccesary thoughts of of my head.
9. Gain resilience to quickly recove from stress.

Those mentioned above are only a small part of advantages for mindfulness. More positive outcomes will be brought when constantly fulfilling mindfulness on daily basis.

### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness? 
    
- I sometimes do a bit of meditation for myself to clear up my head from noisy signals then it actually helps maintaining inner peace.
- Playing tennis about twice a week to get physically healthy so it will bring healthy mentality to my brain.

# Listening and Looping 

### What was it like to be fully listened to? 

When the other was fully listening to what I have said, I was feeling a respect to the other during the conversation.

### What was it like to fully listen?

By trying to concentrate to what other is saying, I could fully understand the other's side of opinion.

I have learnt that fully listening is very important in all kinds of communication to make respect with each other so it can build up more solid relationship for productive outcomes. 


# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?

Learn the basics first especially the syntax, then step to advanced levels dealing with functions and logic.

### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?

I could not stick to timeboxes this time as I actually wanted to master the fundamentals of the javascript. 
Personally believe that the one being proficient in the basics can be more successful in advanced levels.
So I had to go through a number of youtube tutorials to learn more about JS as much as I can within this sprint.
The concept of language was quite similar to what I have learnt previously which was Python, however I noticed that there are quite many difference between these two languages so it took me more time to get used to it.



# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?

Yes, this lecture actually helped me solidifying the concept of combining JS and the DOM together. 

### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?

The syntax of JS is pretty similar to the Python, but I learnt more about built-in JS methods from this activity.
