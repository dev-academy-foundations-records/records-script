# Final Reflections - Sprint Three 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

Regarding emotional intelligence, I am yet far to reach the top of this stage as I need more mental habits to control myself :)
I would say that 30% confident about JS area, still needing to study more about it.


### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?

Whenever the codes worked in all challenges, it made me happy.

### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?

Not really made me angry as codes do not always work as I expected. 
Honestly a bit annoyed when it had errors due to small spelling discrepancy and I had to find them.

### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?

Did not attempt to give up at any chance, I'd rather had a rest when things did not work well then come back again.
