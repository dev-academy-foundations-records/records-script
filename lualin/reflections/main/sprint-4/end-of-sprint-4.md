# Final Reflections - Sprint Four 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

Regarding the core part of this week's sprint, it was great getting to know about neuroplasticity which explains growth possibility of our brains.
I was confident on this part especially by understanding how my brains could develop via learning experiences and expecting the possibility of improving my growth mindset during this bootcamp.
Doing Kata challenge was really worth to understand the javascript furthermore such as appropriate use of for-loop, syntax, fundamental logics and built-in methods.
This helped improving my learning competency about javascript as I kept searching on topics I did not understand and dive into them for revision as well.

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?

When the logic I thought of worked as expected :)


### Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?

When the code was not working due to small typo (like excluding s at the end of variable.)


### How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?

Consuming chocolate at the end of challenge to cool down my brain and having a short break for relax.

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say? 

I would send a message to the past of me like 'thinkg more about the logic flow, it would be better to comment things to build first then make codes for each of them'
