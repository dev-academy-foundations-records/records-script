# My Reflections - Sprint Five 


# Tic-Tac-Toe

### What was the most challenging part of this exercise for you?

Converting the tic-tac-toe algorithm to actual codes was challenging part as I had to consider so many factors and possibilities this game makes.

### What learning(s) are you going to takeaway from this exercise?

This exercise requires more intensive logics to deal with possibilities so I could learn much from this part.

# Pair Programming

### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?

Few times before this course when working in as a former developer and doing some tiny projects with friends.
Unfornately I have not ever used Github at the past experiences which had very inefficient workflow at all.
I cannot really remember how I could have done these without Github but now I can at least use Github for better version control.

### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during Bootcamp? Why so?

Not really, I am prepared to be commited to working with others in good communication and dedicating on hard work!
There might be challenges in reality when I get encountered to the situation but I should overcome tactfully I hope.


# Inflate the Unicorn

### Did you learn anything new during this exercise? What was it? 

I learnt ways to add audio files and import codes from external source in javascript which I was not familiar with it yet.


### Did you encounter issues completing any of the steps of this exercise? How did you resolve this?

I had a small issue when importing codes from external source as the js file could not really import the external codes.
Googled it and found a solution to resolve it by adding a simple bit of codes into html.
I had to add 'type="module"' into the src tag in html to import the code properly


### If you were to replace the unicorn with another mystical animal of your choice, what would it be?

Maybe the nine tailed fox ðŸ¦Š


# Whack-a-mole

### What was the hardest part of this exercise?

The concept of game was clear but it was hard to write codes in appropriate way to make it functioning properly.
It still has few bugs that are not fixed yet such as incrementing hit counter number.


### Can you think of any different ways you could have accomplished the same outcome?

Not really, that was the best outcome I could make.


# Dress the Clown

### How did you find the process of refactoring your code?

For better readibility, I have placed the global variables at the top of the codes and put comments of every main codes as possible to be recognisable.
Attempted to seperate codes effectively by putting them into functions as possible to make it clean.


### Would you do anything differently if you were to start this challenge again?

I actaully have worked on this part with number of refactoring process so I can't think of any now.



### What piece of code are you proudest of from this exercise?

Maybe the main function called arrowHandler() as I tried to make this function minimal by splitting the inside handling codes in seperate functions.


# JS Carnival

### What parts of these challenges did you enjoy? If we were to add more challenges, what would you like to have more of?

I enjoyed working on 'dress the clown' part from the challenges as it includes many factors to deal with keys handling functions.
And I think it would be better to add some resources for error handling skills in this JS challenges.


### What parts weren't so good? Were there any parts that you felt stuck on?

I was stuck on the same part of the challenge as per the above by placing a variable at wrong place and it took me almost 2 hours to figure it out.


### Which parts made you feel confident?

After 2 hours of struggling with it out via research and refactor, if made me feel confident that I eventually solved it.


### What personally would you want changed to improve the carnival?

I personally think a bit of error handling skills could help improving the carnival challenges.
There are so many cases where the codes could go wrong way but adding a bit of these handlers might help I guess.
