# Final Reflections - Sprint Five 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:


### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?

Working on practical coding excercises to improve coding skills and be confident of what was learnt during each sprint.

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?

I believe that every single part of foundations was useful and worth to learn including tech and core parts.
To say what I have been feeling bad was that codes always do not work as I expected. 

### Was Foundations what you expected it to be like? If not, what was different?

Yes mostly except the core parts. I have not really expected this amount of core parts however it was really worth to learn about them.


### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?

Countless, frankly everytime I got stuck at coding exercises. But I told to myself everytime that I won't be able to achieve anything if I give up on this. And it kept me going.


### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?

I have reached to this course to accomplish my future goal to be a developer. 
Even though I have lack of skills yet, I am prepared for the bootcamp to passionately improve myself furthermore.

### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?

I hope I can survive after 10 weeks from now. However, based on my characteristic, it might say like 'Just keep going, you are sill alive in this future'.

### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?

Maybe half programmer, I still need to have more constant habit on learning and coding.
