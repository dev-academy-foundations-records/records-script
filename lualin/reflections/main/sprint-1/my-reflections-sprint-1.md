# My Reflections - Sprint One

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?

Command line enables user to provide orders to the machine in few lines via terminal to accomplish specific tasks.
Very useful tool for programmer to make workflow faster.

### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

Yes, I stick to the timebox guidelines to ensure that I am managing my time efficiently on each task.
This is especially crucial for programmers to manage their time wisely within schedule.

### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

- pwd: Shows current directory
- cd []: Moves to specific folder (cd .. : Moves to one directory up)
- ls: Shows list of files in current folder
- mkdir/touch: Creates a folder/file with name
- clear (cmd+K): Clears terminal

### Did you learn anything unexpected?

I managed to learn more useful commands to manage files such as rm/mv from the given command line cheat sheet. That is very good to know :)

# Version Control with Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?

Git:
Git is a version control system to help recording and managing the history of my own codes and history. Not cloud based but being installed and managed in local system. I can manage the code versions that keep stacking up on my own. Totally indepent system where it can be worked without internet neither the cloud platform.

The charming point of Git is branch where the user can create an another independent branch from main code. When new idea pops up, new codes can be added under branch that will not interfere the main code. Creating another branch, reversing to previous branch, deleting and merging are good advantages for productive workflow.

Using Git on local machine is only recommended for individual project as codes will not be uploaded and updated on cloud when there is a team involved in this project.

GitHub:
GitHub is cloud based hosing service where manages Git repositories.
Codes can be shared with others via GitHub so this will give huge advantages to projects working in team basis.

### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?

Git/GitHub can be described as recipe book and restaurant respectively.
Git is like recipe book which contains recipe of dishes including ingredients and instructions on how to cook them. It could contain versions of recipe as it might slightly change.

Github, on the other hand, is like restaurant where you can try the dishes that were made from the recipe book. I might order, ask for the recipe if I like it or even suggest a new menu which could be considered by the chef to add it to the menu.

### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?

Not at this stage, what I have been doing in Github previously is pretty much tasting. I learnt quite many things from the materials in Sprint 1 and searched other references in Youtube to clearly understand how Git/GitHub work in individual and team-base development environments. Thus I am going to do some revision of them in rest of this week and make notes for future reference.

### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

I have managed to understand concepts of Git/GitHub within 30 minutes that was really not enough for me as I searched many references via given suggestions and Youtube. Actually spent more than suggested timebox for exploring.

# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a Git workflow?

- Working directory: Literally a working directory when a developer is working on where contains all files being developed.

- Staging area: By using command 'git add [filename]' in terminal, selected files are moved to staging area to be prepared for commit.

- .git directories: By using command 'git commit -m "msg"' in terminal, those selected files in staging area are added to .git directories with unique hash for version control.

### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

I tried to understand Git workflow with all related commands and it actuall took longer than I thought to clarify. But it seems to be ok now :) more revision to go.

### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?

Going to more focus on git commands to learn how each of them is functioning.

# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?

I would describe that staging area is like selecting good looking photos from your Iphone to edit for instagram posts. Then selected photos will be posted on Instagram with some messages which can be descirbed as commit in Git. The post can be edited either.

# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?

The default branch name in Git.

### Why create a Branch?

When deveoping a software in a team, developers normally cooperate together for new features development, debugging and etc on same source code. Then 'Branch' in Git enables number of developers to complete different tasks without affecting the main source code.
Therfore, a single project can be managed in many pathways using branch feature in Git. Developer can easily work on the source code in independent branch.

### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?

The concept of branch in Git is very intuitive to understand as developers should have a place to work on source code safely without affecting the main code.

# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?

When a random user would like to add features to someone's repository, then the user can bring the source code to user's repository to develop on the source code without permission. This will not affect the origin source code however the user still can request for a pull to the owner of source code if the original owner accepts to merge the added codes.

The advantage of this feature is that anyone can add any creative ideas to the software on their own.

### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

Yes, when all things are working as I expected without any bugs :) But I am pretty sure that I will see bunch of them very soon.

# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?

None, the instructions were straightforward to understand.

### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

I actually have not deployed websites via GitHub however this is quite cool and easy feature to deploy a website with only few settings. Back in the days when I was working as web developer, deploying a website on server was not really a easy task and very inefficient to update any changes. But I can realise now why developers must be loving GitHub.

# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?

My way to solve problems when I encounter them is normally as follows:

1. Find what have caused the problems in the codes.
2. Logically think about what kind of measures can be taken to resolve these problems.
3. Do some research to gather related information about the problems.
4. Apply potential solutions until they are solved.
5. Test the codes if anything could possibly go wrong.

I am trying to learn more specific ways of problem-solving skills that will be highly essential to be a good programmer. 
If I will be working in IT industry as a developer in the future, it is very important to have a sound mindset in programmer way whenever I will face countless problems. Did some research what kinds of things a developer should have in everyday lifecycle throught their career, then three main questions below are what I always must have in my mind.

- What was the cause of problem?
- Why am I trying to solve this problem?
- How can I solve this problem?

As especially there are always no perfectly correct answers in development, a developer needs to have good capacity to find out the reasonable answers and is able to decide a best opion at given circumstances.

# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?

Just a normal person with high passion of tech things but with an aesthetic peronality.


### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?

Yes I really love my own personality with confidence and tend to evaluate my values as high as possible to build stronger self-esteem. 
Sometimes it is hard to find who really I am but trying to stay positive for having healthy ego of myself.
