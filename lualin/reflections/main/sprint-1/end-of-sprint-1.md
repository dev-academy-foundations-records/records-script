# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?

Following all the instructions as stated in the curriculum and sticking to the given timebox to meet the requirements of each task.
Spending more time to study on what I have not fully understood and keep practicing.
I have not faced any problems within Sprint 1 yet.

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

Quite confident with thinking competency however I think I need to develop my communications skills with others.


### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?

Enjoyed about diving into Git/GitHub parts that are said to be most important for developers. Learning about them is very useful and I got to keep practicing on it to get used to it.

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

Not gonna say tedious but thinking about my values, identity was hard part for me as I haven't seemed to look after myself for a while. 
Kinda philosophic part but it was still good opportunity to look behind of myself to know who I am and my values.


### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

Throughout the learning process during sprint 1, my brain has been telling me to not be distracted and it is still telling me now. 
It is especially hard to focus on things when studying or working alone at home, I think I need to construct a solid habits to focus harder.
