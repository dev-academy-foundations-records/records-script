Next sprint, you will publish this document as a blog post which will be visible to your cohort and Facilitator. Your blog participation counts towards your overall assessment. Until then, write your findings on a temporary document (Google docs, notepad, text edit etc.).

During this exercise we'll ask you to recall and discuss situations from your past. These do not need to be highly detailed and what you're comfortable sharing is up to you. What's important is the discussion of your values and identity. If you have any questions, chat to your Facilitator.

The aim of this blog is to reflect on your core personal values, and your strengths and limitations.

Your blog post should include the following:

1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.

3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.

4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?

5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
