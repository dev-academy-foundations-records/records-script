# Final Reflections - Sprint Five

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?

Just finishing everything I think. It's always satisfying to complete a body of work.

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?

Bad time management and then stressing out about getting stuff done.

### Was Foundations what you expected it to be like? If not, what was different?

Yes, I think so!

### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?

None, if I couldn't do something I just kept trying until it worked.

### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?

Not super prepared! I wanted to do more of my own coding and do the stretch exercises, but time has really crept up on me.

### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?

Congratulations, you made it through! You're a star! Hope you have fun in America!

### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?

Yes and no - I feel like I'm learning to be a programmer by doing programming!
