# My Reflections - Sprint Five

# Tic-Tac-Toe

### What was the most challenging part of this exercise for you?

The grid stuff was a little bit hard to wrap my head around.

### What learning(s) are you going to takeaway from this exercise?

You can make cool interactive things and they don't have to be super hard to code!

# Pair Programming

### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?

No, but Sparrow and I tried it out to talk over the dress the clown exercise. The coding was a lot slower - I think I do most of my coding in deep focus situations, so it's quite distracing to work with someone else. But I think I understood the concepts that we discussed way better than I otherwise would have!

### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during Bootcamp? Why so?

Yes (see above), but I think it will be super rewarding!

# Inflate the Unicorn

### Did you learn anything new during this exercise? What was it?

It was fun importing the confetti script and using it in the exercise.

### Did you encounter issues completing any of the steps of this exercise? How did you resolve this?

Just kept playing around!

### If you were to replace the unicorn with another mystical animal of your choice, what would it be?

A Chimera!

# Whack-a-mole

### What was the hardest part of this exercise?

I got a bit stuck trying to get the clicking area to go to the new randomly generated location, but figured it out eventually!

### Can you think of any different ways you could have accomplished the same outcome?

To be honest my brain is pretty fried right now

# Dress the Clown

### How did you find the process of refactoring your code?

I'm not sure that I actually refactored it - I just kept rewriting it until it worked

### Would you do anything differently if you were to start this challenge again?

Nope

### What piece of code are you proudest of from this exercise?

All of it - it took a lot of fiddling around

# JS Carnival

### What parts of these challenges did you enjoy? If we were to add more challenges, what would you like to have more of?

I like that they were little games!

### What parts weren't so good? Were there any parts that you felt stuck on?

I liked them all! I think the looping logic and if statements made my brain melt a little bit though.

### Which parts made you feel confident?

I think just finishing everything!

### What personally would you want changed to improve the carnival?

Nothing! It was all fun.
