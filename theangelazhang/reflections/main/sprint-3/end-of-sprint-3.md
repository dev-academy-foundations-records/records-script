# Final Reflections - Sprint Three

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I'm semi confident with basic Javascript, but very low confidence with the DOM stuff!

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?

Getting through the Javascript challenges was very satisfying.

### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?

All of the DOM things! I think I need to do some more reading up on it.

### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?

I did give up on doing the stretch exercises for the Javascript Cafe exercise because I ran out of time. But the other modules I just kept trying until it worked.
