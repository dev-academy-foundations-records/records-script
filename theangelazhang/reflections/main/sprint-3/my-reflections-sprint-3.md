# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

I think mindfulness is super important! I'm trying to cultivate a mindfulness practice around being more present every day, being more aware of my body, and noticing what I'm thinking. I'm so anxious and in my head all the time — I think being more in the moment would really increase the quality of my life. I'm sporadically using Headspace, but I do find it hard to stick with routines.

### How did you find the overall experience?

Good! I always find it refreshing to be able to take some time out of my day to be mindful.

### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness?

I think just trying to keep up a mindfulness habit - trying to be more consistent with Headspace. I think managing my sleep is also part of being mindful.

# Listening and Looping

### What was it like to be fully listened to?

Good! I was able to take my time to talk and not be afraid that somebody was going to interrupt me. But it was also quite disconcerting to talk for 2 minutes straight.

### What was it like to fully listen?

Also good! I did have to moderate the urge to comment on things that the other person said.

# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?

I think I learn best by putting the learnings into practice and figuring things out as I go. I have a very limited attention span for any kind of reading or lecture — I tend to just zone out.

### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?

Yes I kept within the timebox suggestions.

# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?

Yeah, it was really helpful. I need to get faster at typing though!

### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?

I need to learn more about manipulating the DOM in my own time.
