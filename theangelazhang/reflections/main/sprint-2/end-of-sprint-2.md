# Final Reflections - Sprint Two

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?

Not super confident but I'm sure I'll gain confidence as I get more practice.

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?

I think just finally managing to complete my website! (Still a work in progress though.)

### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?

This week was a bit hectic for me - a run-on effect is that I managed my time poorly which has been super anxiety-inducing!

### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?

Just been trying to stop beating myself up for leaving things to the last minute again.

### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?

I'd say it's really easy - just sign up at Squarespace or Wix! (I'm kidding)
