# My Reflections - Sprint Two

# Your Blog

### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?

I created a new blog page for my github.io website about Te Houtaewa, made a document to hold some future page styling information, and then linked this styling page to my Te Houtaewa blog page. I then uploaded all of these pages onto Github.

### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?

Good, except I sometimes forget to turn it off when I start doing something else.

# Learn HTML and CSS

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?

I found it hard to remember all the new CSS syntax, and also found all the hierarchy stuff confusing! I'm sure I'll understand it better once I actually have to use it, but for now I only have a vague understanding.

### What are of you proud of from this challenge?

Getting through it!

# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?

I found it helpful to open up my own version of the website he was showing us and follow along. He did lose me a bit once he started using Javacript to log things on the console. He used a whole bunch of terms that we haven't come across yet.

### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?

I struggled when he started using Javascript and a bunch of terms that I didn't understand. But I think I just accepted that I wouldn't understand the entire tutorial with the limited knowledge I have now, and just continued watching to the end.

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

I have 59 tabs open. 7 of them are distraction tabs and the rest are tabs that I opened for previous Dev Academy tasks but didn't close. Half of them are me trying to troubleshoot how to get F5 run to work in VS code when the home directory is set to wsl.localhost. I haven't managed to figure it out - only workaround it to open the file outside of the command prompt. Any tips?

### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.

Yep, just did some basic messing around.

# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.

This year I decided to make my partner a web dev birthday cake. I mixed up some HTML flavoured batter, using a bunch of different ingredients including a header, a footer and the main feature - some juicy body content. It baked perfectly, but I knew it needed some pizzaz - CSS! I covered the cake in some flexbox icing with some media query sprinkles. I didn't have time to get any fun JSS candles or electrical cake toppers, but my partner still loved it. She said it was full of sustenance and looked great to boot!

### Any moments of surprise or joy?

I definitely felt joy when I finally got the flexbox elements looking the way I wanted them to! Lots of fiddling around.

### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?

I feel like HTML would be an old turtoise - not flashy but full of life experience and stories. CSS would be a rainbow lorikeet, flitting around and looking pretty.
