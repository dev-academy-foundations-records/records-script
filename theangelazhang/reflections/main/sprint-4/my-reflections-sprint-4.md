# My Reflections - Sprint Four

# Code Readability

### What makes code more readable for you?

Good indenting and structuring using comments.

### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?

Is this a trick question? Tabs~

### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?

Messy! My blog code is currently pretty messy but I don't think that's a reflection of what my code will look like going forwards.

# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    let expected = 7
    let actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```

### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`:

```
function sum(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

```

### Do you think you would prefer using Test Driven Development? Why?

I like it - it's like making your own goal and then achieving it. It seems super satisfying.

# Kata

### How did you find using repl.it in practice? Confusing? Useful?

Didn't use it.

### Was it helpful to look at the tests while coding the kata?

Absolutely. The tests helped me to figure out what the code was supposed to do.

### What problem solving techniques did you implement in your coding flow?

Lots of Googline.

### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?

Remembering what a switch statement is was fun.

### Did you want to change and refactor your code once you were finished?

Yes, and I did.
