# My Reflections - Sprint One

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?

The command line is a place where you can write commands (also known as prompts) and the computer will execute them for you. It‚Äôs like telling somebody what to do/giving directions, except you write it down, and you‚Äôre telling a computer.

### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

Yep!

### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1. cd - go to location
2. mkdir - make directory
3. ls - look at what‚Äôs in the directory you‚Äôre in
4. code <file name> - open up a file in vs code
5. rm -r - remove directory

### Did you learn anything unexpected?

Just that Git and GitHub are really cool!

# Version Control with Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is a tool for version control, and GitHub is basically a file storage website.

### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?

Not the greatest analogy but I guess Git is like the track changes tool in a Google Doc, and GitHub is like Google Drive.

### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?

Yes!

### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

Yep!

# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a Git workflow?

The way in which Git is incorporated into the way you work.

### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

I found it really hard to stay focused - I kept getting distracted. When I was confused or blocked, I just tried out different things until it worked.

### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?

I don't think so!

# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?

Staging is getting something ready to be committed, committing is the actual saving of the file/s - like a checkpoint in a game.

# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?

The master copy of the code - the most perfect version that you make your branches off of, and merge your branches back into.

### Why create a Branch?

So you can make changes without affecting the main code - like an alternate timeline that you can merge back into your main code.

### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?

I think they're fairly intuitive!

# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?

If you want to make some personal edits to some code that you don't have the permissions for, or you want to have a copy of some code saved to your own GitHub page.

### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

I think it's clicking as I go along.

# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?

I didn't really get to feel frustrated because I already had a github.io set up - just needed to delete all the folders and files in it.

### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

Have made a website hosted on GitHub before for my partner, because it's super cheap - just needed to buy a domain name.

# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?

Try out stuff until it works! The internet seems to be telling me that thinking like a programmer is all about being a problem solver - about being able to see a problem from many different angles, thinking logically, and breaking down big problems into smaller steps. Flipped learning is about getting students to do the basic learning/readings in their own time, and then spending class time actually applying these learnings.

# Introduce yourself

Kia ora, my name is Angela (they/she/zem). I'm currently based in TƒÅmaki Makaurau, but will be moving to the US next year.

I've been thinking a lot about what it means to live authentically ‚Äî to do what I want instead of what I feel like I should be doing. I think guilt and obligation have ruled a lot of my life. So I've just quit my job as a geotechnical engineer, am in the process of shaking off all those preconceived notions of responsibility, and am embracing the expansive feeling of being untethered and unaccountable. I've also recently realised that I'm autistic and have ADHD, so am trying to be kinder to myself about the challenges that come with being alive.

I've always really enjoyed coding and fiddling around with computers. I also spend most of my life staring at various screens and doom-scrolling, but for some reason never considered studying anything computer-related. (Maybe because my stepdad works in cyber-security so I thought it was super un-cool.) But here I am, in the process of aligning my life with my brain chemistry and values, and feeling really lucky to be attending Dev Academy! ü•≥

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?

A bit weird - always have to make sure I'm not uncomfortably oversharing, while still providing enough for people to get a sense of who I am. A fine balance!

### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?

I guess? It ties in with the trying not to overshare haha!
