# Final Reflections - Sprint One

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?

My strategy of just trying things until it works out seemed to serve me well. Not really any issues so far.

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

Medium confident - could definitely do with some more practice, but I guess we'll get there.

### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?

Executing things in the command line is super satisfying.

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

The reading - I find it a bit hard to concentrate when looking at walls of text. Much prefer putting the learnings into practice

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

Maybe a voice berating me for not being able to concentrate? I just have a super short attention span! But I took my ADHD meds and powered through, and am submitting early which is pretty rare for me. (I'm the kind of person who submits something due at midnight at like 11:58pm.)
