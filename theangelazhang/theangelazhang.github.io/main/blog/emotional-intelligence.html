    <p><strong>What is emotional intelligence?</strong><br><br>

      Emotional intelligence (also known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to manage both your own emotions and understand the emotions of people around you. <br><br>
  
      <strong>How is EQ different to IQ?</strong> <br><br>

      Intelligence quotient (IQ) testing predates EQ by almost an entire century. In the early 1900s the first intelligence tests were developed, as a supposedly unbiased way to measure a person’s cognitive ability. They were an easy way for institutions such as the military and police to screen potential applicants. They were also used to justify eugenics, as they helped to popularise the belief that a person’s intelligence was determined by their biology and race, and that systematic inequalities were just a result of evolution. As a result of these arguments, tens of thousands of Americans with developmental disabilities and “feeble minds” were forcibly sterilised. <br><br>

      Unlike IQ, which is a measure of cognitive abilities and intellectual potential, EQ is a measure of emotional intelligence, a concept popularised in the 1990s. It is important to recognise that EQ was also developed in a western, individualistic context — framing EQ as a personal quality that can be improved through individual effort disregards the fact that emotional experiences can be greatly impacted by socio-cultural and neurological factors. EQ is often used in a business context, as a factor in hiring, promotions and performance reviews. When used in this way, EQ can perpetuate existing social biases and discrimination, and reinforce existing racist and ableist power structures. For example, “cultural fit” is often used to justify unconscious (and conscious) biases in hiring decisions. I worked for a company that made a dozen people redundant as a cost cutting measure — Covid-19 was a great excuse to trim people who weren’t a “good fit” for the company. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that all of these people were either immigrants or (in my mind, at least) neurodivergent.

      <strong>Why is EQ important?</strong><br><br>

      Developing EQ can help improve a person’s overall quality of life by enhancing their relationship with themselves and with others. EQ can promote emotional well-being by helping people develop self-awareness and coping strategies. EQ can enhance communication and empathy, build trust with others, foster collaboration, and can equip people with the skills needed to manage conflicts in a constructive manner.<br><br> 

      Having EQ also gets you hired, promoted and not made redundant.
