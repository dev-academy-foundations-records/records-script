     <p>TW: emotional abuse <br><br>
       
      I grew up believing that I could do anything, that I could achieve anything that I wanted to if I worked hard enough. I am very privileged, I think, that school always came easy to me, and that my mum (despite her faults) supported me in all my academic and artistic pursuits. 
      
      <br><br>

      I was never particularly achievement-focused—I was more interested in whatever captured my curiosity at any given moment. In fact I was often downright disruptive in school, passing notes, taking apart people’s pens, sleeping in class. I didn’t care about what other people thought of me. I did things because I wanted to, and I never doubted myself or my intuition. That started to change when I realised that I was queer, and by extension, disgusting and unloveable.  
      <br><br>

      I met Erica in my second to last year of high school. She seemed straight, but that had never stopped me crushing on somebody before, and the unattainability made it fun. I liked her pseudo-American accent and the way she tucked her hair behind her ears. Erica's parents were overseas and my parents' love language was service, i.e. working long hours. When we weren’t spending every waking moment after school hanging out in malls, libraries and deserted playgrounds, we were on the phone to each other incessantly. People started mistaking us for each other, even though I wear glasses and she has long hair. When she told me that she loved me at 4am the morning before a science test, I remember feeling like my heart had been enveloped in sunshine. It was the first time I felt like I had a future—a world where I was desired and seen, a whirlwind of possibilities. <br><br> 

      I don’t know whether it’s because relationships like ours aren’t usually depicted as sites of abuse or because I have perfected the act of self-gaslighting, but it took me a long time to define our relationship as what it swiftly became: a relationship in which I was continually emotionally abused. Erica sometimes publicly, but mostly privately made me feel worthless. She would tell me that my art was shit, that my music was embarrassing, that people were only hanging out with me because they didn’t know the real me. Erica got angry at me for crying in public, got angry at me for trying to make new friends, and called me a narcissist when I tried to share happy news about my life with her. We were together for five years. She was deeply closeted the entire time. Even now, most of our high school and university friends don’t know that we were dating.   
      <br><br>

      Whenever I called Erica out on anything, she would make me feel like what I experienced was not real. I still find myself appropriating the way that she looked at me, and I constantly doubt my own worth and whether how I perceive the world is even real. Even as I write this, I wonder whether it was all really that bad. Even after six years of trying to heal myself, I still find it hard to afford myself compassion. These are all skills I learnt from Erica. Before I met her, I was a zany, creative and let’s be real, a slightly strange kid. I wore a tiger hat for several years and for a school dance, I whizzed around the dancefloor on a scooter. I am filled with an immense amount of grief looking back, because I don’t see that within me anymore. Erica made me feel like a burden and a freak.<br><br>


      The good news is that I still believe that my academic performance is a direct result of how hard I have studied. I’m doing a psychology degree for fun at the moment, and after we received our grades for a multi-choice open-book online test, I overheard what seemed to me, quite a bizarre take. The CEO of the Spirit of Adventure Trust was disappointed in his score, but instead of reflecting on what he could have done better, he blamed the test for being “poorly written, designed to overwhelm and catch us out”. He said it was one of the hardest things he’s ever done, including raising a family and leading large teams of people. He threatened to move to the Massey psychology programme. I don’t think the test was abnormally difficult—the class average was 73%. The CEO couldn’t deal with getting a low grade but also either didn’t want to put in more work, or thought that this was as well as he could do. Looking back, this is an example of a fixed mindset—he didn’t want to, or didn’t believe that he could grow and do better. He gave up in the end, and dropped out.<br><br>

      Although my relationship with studying is much the same as before, the way I relate to creative practices has completely changed. I no longer experiment or do random crappy things for fun. I second guess everything I do. I shoot myself in the foot before I even start. I haven’t done any painting since 2013. I will write a paragraph and then delete everything because it’s all shit anyway, so what’s the point? My neuroplastic brain has carved deep neural ravines in the shape of Erica’s voice, which has also become my voice. I am actively trying to rewire these negative electrochemical pathways. I often think about something my friend Nathan said on a podcast — that artists are probably going to suck when they start out. The ones that manage to push through are often the ones who have had advocates and champions. I think about who in my life I can advocate for, and I also think… what if I became my own champion?

And that’s okay. But what happened was that there were really encouraging people. [...] The importance of mentor figures and advocates or champions is something I talk about a lot, but without them most young emerging creatives just wouldn’t have the fuel to make the things they want to make. They feed our ego in a way. They give us the sense that we can do anything, or that we have something to say. And most of the time we do, but they’re probably being a bit generous and that’s actually quite helpful.<br><br>

      I don’t think robust criticism is actually what young creatives always need. I think support is. Because you kind of need to get over the hurdle of believing in yourself before you can get over the hurdle of becoming good, to be honest. Because good is such a slippery quality anyway. The notion of mastery as well—like 75,000 hours or something? I can’t even remember. 10,000 hours? I don’t know, but it’s a lot of hours. But to even get to that point of wanting to spend time doing something for that long requires encouragement, on like, a really basic level. And some people are born maybe knowing that they’re good at something, but I think most people are born with a sense of insecurity and bafflement about what they’re even doing. So for me, encountering a mentor who was like ‘hey, go for it’ was the first step.” <br><br><br>
