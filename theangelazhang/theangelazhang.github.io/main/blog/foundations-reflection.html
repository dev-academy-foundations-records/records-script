    <p><strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
    </strong><br><br>

    When left to my own devices I have trouble starting things and focusing, even when doing things that I enjoy. I know I can eventually figure out problems given enough time, so it’s quite frustrating to me that I didn’t complete most of the stretch exercises, simply because I started most of the sprints the night before they were due. I think being physically on campus, around other people, and pair programming will help keep me accountable. I can let my anxiety fuel me instead of overwhelm me.<br><br>  

    I found out that my brain shuts off when I do pair programming. I find that most of the mental energy that I usually use to solve technical problems is expended observing and reacting to my coding partner. I can’t help but anxiously parse every element of every social interaction I ever have. It’s exhausting and I want to stop watching so closely, but I just can’t. It’s part of what makes being at work and just generally being around people so draining. I often feel like I completely dissociate as soon as I enter a social setting — like I exit my body and I only return to it when I arrive home, lock my bedroom door and curl up in bed. I’ve tried so hard to get over it, to try and train myself out of it by going to networking events and work functions. But a coffee catch up with somebody will still derail my entire day. I’ve stopped going to the gym during staffed hours because I’ve had some friendly conversations with the (very lovely) guy at the front desk, and now I’m afraid that if I go while he’s there I’ll have to talk to him, and I just can’t bear the thought. Because trying to moderate my constant wide-eyed hypervigilance is futile, I’ve decided that the only thing I can do is try and manage my energy carefully — to avoid doing soul-sucking activites, so that I have stamina left to do the things I actually want to do. I’m currently not very successful, but Bootcamp will be a great training ground.<br><br>  
    
    I’ve also learnt that I can’t help but overcommit to heaps of things even when I’m trying my darndest to focus on one activity (foundations). I just can’t sit still. I always wonder what on earth my past self was thinking when they signed me up to do so many things. I wonder about this while I sign my future self up for a billion more commitments.

      <strong>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</strong> <br><br>

      I think these are just pretty important life skills in general! I think the world would be better if people were more empathetic and self-aware. I also sometimes wonder if these qualities are subjective — I’m sure homophobic and transphobic people think they are kind and good people. I’m sure racists think of themselves as lovely people. Sometimes people saying that they’re empathetic is a red flag. I have a high school friend that I’ve been feeling weird about for a while. I think I realised that they weren’t actually very nice to me this entire time. The last time I met up with them, they told me about how empathetic and open-minded they are, and then proceeded to talk about themselves for the entire duration of our meal. I left confused — why did a self-proclaimed empathetic person not ask me a single question the entire time we hung out? 
      <br><br>

      <strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong><br><br>

      I think it’s just super interesting to see how differently different people approach these questions!<br><br> 

      <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong><br><br>

      Coming up with some fun (or at least not completely boring) answers. I love hearing a good, specific story. I think anecdotes are an excellent way of getting a point across. One of my pet peeves is actually when somebody tells a story that could have been good, but they somehow make it extremely dull. This one story comes to mind — this guy was telling me about how he found the gay love of his life in Thailand but they couldn't be together for some dramatic reason (that I can't remember because the delivery was utterly forgettable). Not saying that I'm the best storyteller but I was just perplexed about how he managed to make that story so monotonous. The lost opportunity... devastating... (Most people are fine — it's not something that happens much. This happened seven years ago but I still think about it frequently.)
      <br><br>

      <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </strong><br><br>

      Most people are here to upskill with the intention of finding a tech job, Dev Academy wants to equip its students for success, and nobody wants to work with a dickhead. <br><br>

      <strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong><br><br>

      Nah, it’s always good to have a chance to reflect! I feel like there are very few opportunities for most adults to spend so much time dwelling on what makes us tick.
