      TW: death, parental relationships<br><br>

      This is probably too much information/oversharing, but just something that’s been at the forefront of my mind during the Lunar New Year. I have an extremely fractured relationship with my mum — she’s not okay with me being queer, thinks I’m ruining my life by going to the US to be with my partner and just generally wants to “fix” every aspect of me. A few months ago I asked her if she wanted to meet my partner and she said “isn’t it a bit too soon for that?” My partner and I have been together for almost five years. My mum tells me that she hopes that my relationship goes sour so that I will meet a guy and have kids. When I explain that being with my partner doesn’t mean that I won’t have kids, she tells me that they wouldn’t count.<br><br>
      
      My mum is a multi-faceted person — she’s wonderful in many ways. She’s funny, she cares deeply, she’s incredibly talented at everything she puts her mind to. My mum has also given up so much for me. It’s been a struggle since the moment we landed in Aotearoa. There is nothing quite as isolating as being halfway across the world from all of your friends and family, struggling to make ends meet as a single parent in a foreign country. I am so grateful for the opportunities that life has afforded me because of my mum’s sacrifices.<br><br>
      
      So I feel torn — she has dedicated so much of her life to me, that now I have left, she doesn’t have anyone around. No friends, no real community. And she’s deeply lonely. (Granted, I didn’t ask for her to give up her life for me, but unfortunately this gift didn’t come with a receipt for returns.) My mum has recently been, rather macabrely, telling me how she thinks that she’s going to die soon. And yes, part of this is to try and guilt-trip me into seeing her more, but I think she also truly believes it. My grandmother died at age 67. All of my grandparents are dead. I have one cousin in China. When my mum dies I know I will feel profoundly alone.<br><br> 
      
      My ethical dilemma is how do I balance my relationship with my mum while keeping myself safe? For most of my life interacting with her has brought me much more pain than joy. My current decision now is to limit our interactions and see her as little as possible, to not tell her anything about my life, and to try not to think about it too much. It’s a constantly evolving situation that I have been in the middle of for a long time, so it’s a little bit hard to reflect on. I feel incredibly guilty, and like a bad child, and (somewhat irrationally) that if she dies young it will be because of me. But I also feel resigned — what will be, will be. All I can do is take it one day at a time.

      <strong>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</strong> <br><br>

      I think I have covered some of this in my answer above. On a happier note, I feel really grateful for the friends that I have now. I’ve recently been vaguely homeless, and the silver lining has been the outpouring of support. It’s been so lovely and affirming to know that even though I sometimes feel very alone, there are lots of people who care. My best friend is letting me stay with her for half a year, free, in Remuera. Another friend invited me to her family Christmas dinner. I sometimes think about why I’m mostly well-adjusted (kind of), and I reckon it’s because I’ve always had good friends that I could confide in. It’s a bit cheesy, but chosen families are real! So I strive to be as generous, thoughtful and kind as the people around me. Life sometimes feels a bit rough, especially with everything going on in the world at the moment, but it’s the relationships with the people close to us that make it sparkle and glisten.

      <strong>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</strong><br><br>

      I’ve done the <a href="https://www.viacharacter.org/">VIA Character Strengths survey</a> a few times now, and some of the strengths do change, I think depending on how I feel on any given day. The ones that consistently show up are “kindness”, “love” and “appreciation of beauty and excellence”. I’d like to think that these strengths mean that I generally get along with people, which definitely helps with learning. I don’t think I would have gotten through my engineering degree without the support of my classmates!<br><br> 

      <strong>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</strong><br><br>

      I think the biggest impediment to my learning and general ability to work is around dysfunctional executive functioning — moderating my attention span, sleeping enough, remembering to eat, staying organised, not procrastinating, not signing up to a million things at once. All of these things impact my daily functioning and ability to be a productive member of society. I either can’t concentrate at all, or hyperfixate for hours on end to the point where I forget to eat and sleep. I’ve tried so many things to be more productive. But for example, a Pomodoro timer doesn’t really work for me because once I’m taken out of the zone, it can take hours, if not days to get back into it. My sleep is currently pretty bad — I’m generally sleeping around 6 or 7am, so when we have our home group catch ups sometimes I haven’t slept very much. Definitely something I need to sort out before the 8am bootcamp starts! <br><br> 

      <strong>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</strong><br><br>

      I interned at a company a couple of years ago, along with five other students. Everyone was really lovely, apart from this one guy who got the job because he did karate with a senior manager. The nepotism hire was shockingly mean, not only to other interns, but to intermediate-level staff as well. He took credit for other people’s work, called multiple people the r-slur, smeared dirt on people, would go around pushing people’s heads into their laptop screen, said things like “man I love making you feel small” to one of the other interns, but worst of all… I watched him pull into an accessible parking spot when there were a bunch of other regular car parks available. He called me a pussy for refusing to lick a dirty pipe. While I was a passenger, he started abruptly braking to 50km/hour on the motorway in front of somebody that was driving slightly under the speed limit. I backed into a parked car while working, which wasn’t actually a big deal because we had great insurance, but the nepo hire started taking photos of me next to the car. He said that he couldn’t wait to tell everyone that I crashed.<br><br>

      There’s lots more, but hopefully that gives you an idea of what this guy was like. I remember all of this because I documented every single instance of bullying and below-the-line behaviour that I witnessed. About five different people, including me, had at multiple points told him that his behaviour was unacceptable and that he needed to cut it out. We were absolutely at our wits end, before I brought my long list of incidents to HR and requested that they deliver an official warning to this guy. He wasn’t rehired next summer.<br><br>

      I think I made the right call. That guy was making multiple people’s lives absolute hell. I personally increasingly dreaded going into the office. We had already staged multiple interventions by the time I instigated the official warning process. This wasn’t one off-behaviour. This was a consistent pattern of disregard and malice towards colleagues. I’m glad he didn’t come back.
