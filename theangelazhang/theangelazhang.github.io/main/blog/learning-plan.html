    <p><strong>(Five-week update before Bootcamp - 17 February)</strong><br><br>

      My thoughts on my learning plan are pretty much the same as before! Some new things I’ve thought of while rereading the questions:<br><br>

      ↬ I want to try to be myself a bit more instead of expending so much energy trying to make other people comfortable. I want to stop laughing at jokes that I don’t think are funny. If I don’t like somebody maybe I’ll actually show it.<br><br> 
      ↬ I want to practise not blanking out while doing pair programming.<br><br>
      ↬ I would love to be more on top of my work and manage my time better. Not sure how this will go, but I think being on campus will help.<br><br>
      ↬ Would love to get better at explaining things to other people.<br><br> 
      ↬ Also desperately want to sleep more! Currently experimenting with melatonin.<br><br>

      <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong><br><br>

      I guess the goal is to become a software engineer! I’m still exploring where exactly I’d want to go with it. The industry seems so broad and diverse. I’m excited to see where it takes me. Ultimately I’d like to be able to work maybe 3 or 4 days a week remotely and do some travelling.

      <strong>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</strong> <br><br>

      I’m nothing if not persistent! I’m very good at pushing through to find a solution or to meet a deadline. Limitations are definitely the things I’ve previously mentioned around executive functioning — focussing my attention, not procrastinating, sleeping enough, etc.
      <br><br>

      <strong>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong><br><br>

      I know this isn’t what you’re really asking, but I’d like to make a friend or two! The last couple of years have been weird, so it’s been cool to start meeting people again.<br><br> 

      <strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</strong><br><br>

      I will try and work consistently to stay on top of things instead of doing everything on the last day. I will try and seek help earlier instead of spending hours Googling. Life does frequently get overwhelming, but I will let facilitators know if it gets to the point where it’s significantly impacting my work.  
      <br><br>

      <strong>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:</strong><br><br>

      It’s been lovely so far. You’re all so super responsive and friendly. Just keep doing you!<br><br>

      <strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things:</strong><br><br>

      I did accidentally sign up to some other commitments but they're fairly flexible! Will let y'all know if anything does ever clash.
