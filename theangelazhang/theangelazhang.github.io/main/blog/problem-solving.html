    <p><strong>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you...<br><br>were blocked on a simple problem:
    </strong><br><br>

       I think I get stuck on life-admin problems much more than technical problems. I can't think of any memorable technical problems but I can think of heaps of issues around just living in general. I guess this isn’t a simple problem, but I’m dealing with a headache-inducing situation around how I’m going to work in the US next year. I can get a partnership visa very easily, but getting authorisation to work and finding a job is a whole other thing. I have just been thinking of every single possible combination and order of events that could happen, and talking them over with my partner. I find that talking to someone else is super helpful, because they can take a step back from the situation and cut through the noise I’ve built up in my head. Even just hearing somebody summarise something that I’ve just said helps me to clarify what I’m feeling and thinking.

      <strong>elegantly solved a problem.</strong> <br><br>

      I was struggling to cite a book in APA7 based on some writings by a guy who died 100 years ago. It was his writing, except it had been edited, anthologised, translated, and then published at a later date by multiple people. I looked at a bunch of other journal papers to see how they had referenced the book, but all the references looked different. I eventually enlisted my partner’s help. They found a <a href="https://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/~steve/courses/cereRefsVyg.html">great resource</a> about why the book is hard to cite, and how to go about doing it in the most ‘proper’ way. However, although the citation that this resource suggested was factually correct, it was also convoluted and didn’t completely follow proper APA conventions. My ultimate solution was to elegantly (haha) cite the book incorrectly and simply in the manner of other journal articles, because I decided that the marker probably wouldn’t be looking that closely anyway.

      <strong>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</strong><br><br>

      <u>Pseudocode:</u> haven’t really had the opportunity to do this yet since the kata questions just laid out all the steps anyway.<br><br>
      <u>Trying something:</u> yes, I keep trying until things work.<br><br>
      <u>Rubber ducky method:</u> haven’t had to do this yet, but I could. And I probably should if I get super stuck on something!<br><br>
      <u>Reading error messages:</u> yes, I do this all the time.<br><br>
      <u>Console.logging:</u> I do this constantly.<br><br>
      <u>Googling:</u> I do this incessantly.<br><br>
      <u>Asking your peers for help:</u> haven’t done this yet, but I could if I needed to.<br><br>
      <u>Asking coaches for help:</u> same as above—haven’t done this yet, but I could. And I think I will heaps in bootcamp (same with asking peers for help.)<br><br>
      <u>Improving your process with reflection:</u> I'm not the best at reflecting, I think because I get bored of thinking about what I've already done—I tend to just want to move onto the next thing. I want to get better at reflecting because I think it would help me stay in and enjoy the present, rather than always compulsively looking ahead.
