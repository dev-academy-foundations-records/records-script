            <h1>Foundations Reflection</h1>
            <h3>1. What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
            <p>I have identified my strengths and weaknesses. I believe that I could do anything I want with my
                perseverance and problem-solving skills. Also, it is so relieving to know the power of Neuroplasticity
                and growth mindset. I am not a smart person, but I can still achieve my goal as a developer with effort
                and practice. Last but not the least, the core learning introduced me mindfulness, which can be very
                helpful to overcome obstacles and frustrations.
            </p>
            <h3>2. What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
            <p>Values are a personâ€™s belief in what is right and what is wrong. They guide us to do things right and
                keep us on the right track of learning.<br />
                Empathy helps us to understand others and foster collaboration within a team, which is important for
                group learning and future employment.<br />
                Self-awareness makes us know our strengths and limitations and make the most use of our strengths to
                achieve the goal.
            </p>
            <h3>3. What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
            <p>I think it was neuroplasticity and growth mindset, as there has always been a stereotype that only clever
                people can code. These concepts really motivated me and gave me confidence in myself.</p>
            <h3>4. What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
            <p>The most challenging part was to explore myself to find out my strengths and limitations, my values and
                my identity. To be honest, I have not thought much about it before, but it was good that I had the
                chance to think about it and had a deeper understanding of myself.</p>
            <h3>5. Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a
                web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
            <p>To make us amazing human beings, hahaha. As we graduate and step into the workplace, we are not just
                being there to do some certain tasks, but also we are bringing ourselves to the team. What we are and
                what we do can influence as well as contribute to the team's success.</p>
            <h3>6. Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just
                used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
            <p>No, it is not a waste of time. The core learning seems not relevant to programming, but it provides the
                best support for us to keep programming. Programming all the time can be tiring, tedious and sometimes
                frustrating. The mindfulness practice we have learnt can help us unwind and the emotional intelligence
                we have learnt helps us recognise our emotions and find ways to process it.</p>
