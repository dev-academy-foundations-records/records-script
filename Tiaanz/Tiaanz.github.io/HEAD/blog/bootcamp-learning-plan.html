            <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
            <h3>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>
                I am hoping to use the skills I have gained during this course to make web applications and contribute
                to the success of the employer.
            </p>
            <h3>2. What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
            <p>My strengths would be still be curiosity, perseverance, and problem-solving skills. However, my
                limitations that I think of in boootcamp would be different from the ones for foundations. I lack
                the experience of working with others, so communication and collaboration within the team might be the
                limitations for me. As I have foreseen my weaknesses in bootcamp, I would prepare myself with a humble
                attitude and seek help from facilitators when necessary.</p>
            <h3>3. What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
            <p>The biggest challenge would be working in groups and speaking up in a group. As I said before, I have no
                experience of programming within a team. Communication and collaboration would be the biggest challenges
                for me.</p>
            <h3>4. What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev
                Academy?
            </h3>
            <p>communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback, developing
                some leadership skills.</p>
            <h3>5. What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
            <p>I believe that the bootcamp team would do their best to support all the students. For me, I just want the
                team to be reachable when needed (not 7/24 of course).
            </p>
            <h3>6. What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
            <p>I hope myself to keep focused throughout the programme and try my best to complete single tasks, pairing
                tasks and group tasks.
                I would seek help from facilitators when I feel stressed and confused about the learning goal and also
                update my learning progress with them regularly.
