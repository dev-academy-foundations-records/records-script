            <h1>Problem-Solving</h1>
            <h3>1. A time I was blocked on a simple problem.</h3>
            <p>
                I was blocked on a simple problem when I was trying to add properties to an object with the
                <code>ForEach()</code> loop.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/problem1.png" alt="problem1">
            <p>This code did not result in an object gradebook with a property for each student in the students array.
                Instead, it will only created a single property student in gradebook and assign an empty object {} to it
                in each iteration of the loop.</p>
            <p>As I knew there was another way to add object properties, which is
                <code>objectName[‘propertyName’]</code>. I experimented with this approach and it worked.
            </p>
            <p>The problem is that student is a variable and its value is not being used to dynamically set the property
                name in the gradebook object.</br>
                This problem solving process was not that hard, but it helped me gain a deeper understanding of objects.
            </p>
            <h3>2. A time I elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
            <p>
                I got a problem as I was doing the <code>capitalization()</code> function. The problem was I was able to
                get the
                first letter of each word in upper case, but the rest part of the word disappeared.</br>
                For example, I was
                hoping to get ‘Hello World’ with the function capitalization( ‘hello world’), but turned out to be ‘H
                W’. I could not come up with a solution so I just googled ‘how to get a sentence capitalized in
                JavaScript?’, then I knew that a <code>slice()</code> method can be used to get the rest part of the
                word and then
                the “+” can be used to connect the capital letter with other letters. I was struggled for a while with
                the problem but it did not take me too long to get it solved.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>• Pseudocode</b>
                    <p>This is a helpful technique, as it helps to analyze the logic for each functionality.
                        By doing this, I will have an idea of what to do and just follow the steps to code instead of
                        getting lost in the middle of coding. I am still getting used to using this technique.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>• Trying something</b>
                    <p>I am confident with this one, as I like to try out my ideas to see if it works.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>• Rubber ducky method</b>
                    <p>I sometimes use this one when I narrow down the problem to a small scope. This means I know where
                        the problem is, so I would keep telling myself what the problem is and I need to find a solution
                        to get the problem sorted. I like this technique, as it makes me focus on the core problem.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>• Reading error messages</b>
                    <p>I am confident with this one. Sometimes I could not understand the error message, I would copy it
                        and paste it to Google, and it shows me how other people who have encountered the same issue get
                        it sorted.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>• Console.logging</b>
                    <p>I like this one very much. Everytime I try out something, I will use <code>console.log()</code>
                        to get the
                        output and see if it works the way I want. Also, for a big block of code, I like to insert
                        <code>console.log()</code> to each line of the code to check where the problematic line of code
                        is.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>• Googling</b>
                    <p>I like this as well and I am very confident in finding solutions through Google search’s result.
                        I normally find solutions through stack overflow, MDN documentation, and W3School.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>• Asking your peers for help</b>
                    <p>I would use this one if it takes me too long to find a solution.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>• Asking coaches for help</b>
                    <p>
                        I have asked help from facilitators at bootcamp when I could not get the tests passed.
                        It was because I did not return the value needed for testing in the function.
                        Asking for help and getting the problem solved along with the facilitator increased my debugging
                        skills.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>• Improving your process with reflection</b>
                    <p>I have not done much of this, but I will move onto this gradually.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.</h3>
            <p>I was reluctant to ask for help at the beginning of dealing with the problem. I would like to give it a
                go solving it by myself. But I would set a time for it and if it takes too long, I would go and ask for
                help.</p>
