            <h1>Foundation Learning Plan</h1>
            <h3>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>
                I would like to enter the tech industry by first finding a job related to front-end development and
                would like to extend my knowledge in back-end development in the long term.
            </p>
            <h3>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
            <p>My strengths are curiosity, perseverance, and problem-solving skills. I am curious about new things and
                love to spend time learning them. When I encounter issues, I would firstly come up with an idea and try
                it. If it does not work, I would keep seeking another one until it is solved.</p>
            <p>My limitation is sometimes spending too much time resolving one problem by myself. I am supposed to turn
                to someone else for help if the problem cannot be solved within a specific amount of time.</p>
            <h3>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at
                Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p>I would like to develop my communication skill and learn how to work in a team when doing a project. I
                have been coding alone most of the time, and really want to know what it is like to work in a team in a
                real working environment.</p>
            <h3>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
                An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,
                Facilitators and industry/community representatives
                What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
            </h3>
            <p>To work productively and safely with others, I would communicate actively with others and make sure I
                understand what I need to do. Also, I would respect others and be open-minded to any comments.</p>
            <p>When things are building up and staring to get to me, I would firstly calm down and think what steps I
                can take to overcome them. If it does not help, I would turn to others for help.</p>
            <h3>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
            <p>I would seek help from the facilitator or other learners whenever I feel like things are getting worse.</p>
            <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
            <p>I expect the facilitator to be not only the one who helps us solve the tech issues but also the one who guides us to work in a team. For example, what to start with when developing a project with others.</p>
            <h3>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
            <p>No, there is not other commitments other than studying, but do need block-out time for relaxing and doing something else to refresh the mind.</p>
