            <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
            <h3>1. What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
            <p>Emotional Intelligence is the capacity to be aware of, control and express one’s emotions and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.</p>
            <h3>2. How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
            <p>IQ refers to your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. EQ refers to your ability to recognize emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions.</p>
            <h3>3. Why is EQ important?</h3>
            <p>EQ is important because it helps us recognize our own and others’ feelings and make wise choices when faced with challenging situations. Also, EQ is important for everyone who works in a team and contributes to a collaborative, productive and empathetic working culture. </p>
            <p>For example, if you feel unhappy with something or someone, instead of being upset by yourself or having an argument with others, you recognize that I am not happy because something or someone does not meet my expectation. Then you find ways to process this emotion. You can talk to someone you trust or put your feet in other people’s shoes and think why they say or do things like that. It helps you regulate your emotions, resolve conflicts with others and communicate effectively.</p>
