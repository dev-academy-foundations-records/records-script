            <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
            <h2>• Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <h3>1. Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
            <p>neuroplasticity tells people that our brains are like malleable plastic that is constantly being reshaped
                by our daily experiences. For example, if you keep practicing new things, you are causing different
                neurons to fire in concert, and it strengthens the connections between those cells. Over time, these
                connections become thick, hardy road maps that link various parts of the brain. Permanent learning
                therefore takes place.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
            <p>I would keep practicing coding. Even though I struggle to understand the logic of the code at first, I do
                not run away but keep repeating it. Everytime I repeat it, I stimulate the neurons to wire together and
                eventually build thicker, stronger, more hard-wired connections in the brain. At the end, I will find
                myself mastering coding.</p>
            <h3>3. What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
            <p>Practice, practice and practice. Also, going out of the comfort zone and confront challenges and
                difficulties. Always looking for solutions rather than running away.</p>
            <h3>4. Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>

            <h2>• Research Growth Mindset</h2>
            <h3>1. Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
            <p>People with a growth mindset believe that they can get smarter and understand that effort makes them
                stronger. If we learners all have growth mindsets, we would not set limitations for ourselves and have a
                faith that I can get achievements if I put extra time and effort. </p>
            <h3>2. In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
            <p>I am impressed with the power of growth mindset. Most of us are not born with high IQ or are extremely
                intelligent, however, it does not stop us from achieving success and happiness if we believe that our
                abilities can be developed through effort.</p>
            <h3>3. How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
            <p>Whenever I encounter difficulties and want to run away, I would tell myself that it is ok to get
                struggled, just take your time and keep trying and you will get it sorted.</p>

            <h2>• Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
            <h3>1. Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
            <p>It gives me confidence in overcoming difficulties throughout the learning period. It enables me to believe that I am capable of doing anything if I put in effort and not defeated by it. Even though I am not that intelligent and new to the coding world, I am still able to achieve success through practice and perseverance. </p>
