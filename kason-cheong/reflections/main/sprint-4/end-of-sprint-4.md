# Final Reflections - Sprint Four 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
I felt like I used the learning competencies as guidelines on what I should be doing for all the different functions and code so that was actually quite helpful.


### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?
I guess that would be going through the final JS olympics, where I used knowledge I had from previous sprints to complete functions and actually felt good about it


### Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?
For some particular excercises, where I spent a few hours just trying different things and hoping that it would work, and seeing that other people seemed to get it 
straight away on the discord or asking more technical or complicated questions.


### How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?
I did get plenty of breaks, as I did hope that I would find the answer after doing something else and coming back to it and surprisingly it did work for me for the most part.


### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say?
To not give up even if the going is hard for sure! As each challenge done is new knowledge gained and being more ready to tackle issues and problems in the future.
