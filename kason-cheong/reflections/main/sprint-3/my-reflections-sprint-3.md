# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness 

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?
I do agree that mindfulness is a very important tool so I am definitely for it. Practising being in the moment opens your mind up to the present, so you're not biased towards decisions you've made in the past or will make in the future, and making the best that you can *now* because that's the only now that matters.


### How did you find the overall experience? 
Going through some of the content that I've seen for mindfulness and what I've done in the past, I do appreciate the breathing and reflection excercises that the app has given me as well. I'll definitely start easy and try to build up time to reflect and practice mindfulness throughout the course as time goes on as well.


### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness? 
I will try to practice some mindfulness and meditation at the end of my work day, to be able to focus on the present and clear my mind to reflect upon myself, and also of course being able to work in the present without worrying about the future as well.




# Listening and Looping 

### What was it like to be fully listened to? 
It was nice, being able to feel like what I said hasn't gone over empty ears and being able to receieve introspection on what I've said as well from other people. During the excercise people did seem to struggle a bit on relaying back information, but hopefully with time it'll get easier as well.


### What was it like to fully listen?
It was difficult to focus entirely on what the other person was saying and all the little details, but I tried my best to focus on the main subjects and relaying that information back to them as well. In a way this was a good reflection on personal mindfulness as well, as being able to be in the moment and listen to others was extremely important in forming informed comments and decisions.
    




# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?
What definitely worked for me was trying out the different things that Joseph showed on the videos, and also trying my best to break down the different functions and explaining to myself how they worked so I understood exactly what was doing what and that made it easier for me to write my own functions as well.


### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?
I definitely sped through the earlier timebox stuff, since I felt like I understood them, but in retrospect I should've spent a bit more time tinkering or reading up more documentation on the basic stuff so I knew extra functions that would help me in further challenges. There was definitely times where I got stuck on very basic challenges and I felt foolish since I had forgetten something basic like quote marks on strings etc.





# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?
It was good, in a way that Joseph also explain what the code was doing, however there was parts where I forgot to format the code correctly so things broke for a bit. I will need to learn to use node.js to diagnose my issues more often and also console.log, too see exactly if a function was running or updating content on a site or page.


### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?
That would definitely be the idea that the page can be updated through events, so I had to make sure that the function that I wanted to run was tied to the event that would update the page as well, so the user can see 
what was going on.
