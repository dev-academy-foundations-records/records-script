# Final Reflections - Sprint Three 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
I felt quite confident in submitting all the work I had to, and also understanding all the competencies as well. Even though I didn't get to finish some of the stretch competencies, I felt like I learnt what I needed to and I did my best even though I was a beginner to programming and the concepts as well.

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?
I definitely was satisfied with how well I managed to make my JS cafe work and getting through some of the stretch competencies, even though I was very confused on how some of the JS worked in the beginning.


### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?
I did feel a bit angry at how I got stuck on some of the javascript tasks, however I did ask questions on the discord and was happy I ended up solving the issue.


### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?
I did feel like I didn't have it in me to be a web dev working through the JS, however I did tell myself that it will take time and it's definitely more than just JS that will count when I finally go out in the industry and it's 
not everything that matters. I also didn't give up as every little thing that I got stuck on is just something that I will be able to work on and learn from later as well.
