# My Reflections - Sprint Five 


# Tic-Tac-Toe

### What was the most challenging part of this exercise for you?
It was definitely trying to follow along the readme but not knowing where exactly your code wasn't working. In the end I did get some help and managed to troubleshoot it, and I finally managed to get it
working so I was glad I did. 


### What learning(s) are you going to takeaway from this exercise?
To double check to see which functions exactly I'm going to call when I click on something, because it seemed like the reason why it wasn't working is because the win function was not done properly.


# Pair Programming

### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?
No, but I did have a pretty good idea about the idea of pair programming because two pair of eyes was definitely better than one, as someone else would be more likely to spot my mistakes as they're
not the one who wrote my code and would be more objective about how something worked. Kind of like how rally drivers and their navigators work together to go around bends or tricky terrain.



### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during Bootcamp? Why so?
Not really, as I do like the idea of working in pairs to get code writing. The only barrier I can imagine bumping into would be trying to use one way to implement a solution but my partner insisting 
on having it done a slightly different way.



# Inflate the Unicorn

### Did you learn anything new during this exercise? What was it?
I tried using event.target to change the src to something else, but that didn't end up working so I just ended up with a regular event listener. I learnt that using variables to store states of an image
was quite handy!

### Did you encounter issues completing any of the steps of this exercise? How did you resolve this?
I did struggle in the beginning to understand how to change the images individually, but it did make a lot more sense once I assigned unique ids to each of the unicorn images.



### If you were to replace the unicorn with another mystical animal of your choice, what would it be?
Would probably be dragons, since dragons are pretty cool. 



# Whack-a-mole

### What was the hardest part of this exercise?
I struggled the most with trying to make the game loop basically, with the act of clicking to remove the mole from the current cell then spawn it in a new one. In the end I managed to create a function to randomize
a cell, put the mole in the new randomized cell and clearing the old cell while updating the counter all into the act of clicking on the mole so I'm glad I got it.



### Can you think of any different ways you could have accomplished the same outcome?
I could have put invisible moles in every cell and made them visible with the randomizer so I wouldn't have to keep making new ones.



# Dress the Clown

### How did you find the process of refactoring your code?
It was definitely rough, as I had to come up with ways that I could shorten the code or combine different functions into a single one but I managed to make it work somewhat in the end, through pseudocode and also
through watching the tutorial videos.



### Would you do anything differently if you were to start this challenge again?
I would definitely start with pseudocode, so I can start with simplified functions from the beginning without having huge chunks of code.



### What piece of code are you proudest of from this exercise?
I think being able to implement keystrokes with indexes to access a certain image was a good learning point for me.



# JS Carnival

### What parts of these challenges did you enjoy? If we were to add more challenges, what would you like to have more of?
I did enjoy having a nice variety of challenges to work on. I also enjoyed working on some of the stretch challenges as well. In the future I would definitely like to try as much of these challenges as possible,
in order to learn a bit of everything js has to offer, so I can at least know the terms and where to look things up if I'm stuck on something.



### What parts weren't so good? Were there any parts that you felt stuck on?
I definitely struggled a bit on all the challenges, however being able to pseudocode and treat it as a problem to be solved without the code does make it easier. I did feel very stuck with the tic tac toe one
as I only really followed along what was on the readme rather than having myself type out the code, so I wasn't sure where exactly I went wrong. 



### Which parts made you feel confident?
I felt pretty confident about the whack a mole for sure, that one was something I was pleasantly surprised to find working when I managed to get all the various functions and also being able to get all the stretch
goals and a bit more on that as well.



### What personally would you want changed to improve the carnival?
Would definitely be a good idea to have extra stretch games to work on too
