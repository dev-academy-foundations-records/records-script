# Final Reflections - Sprint Five 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:


### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?
I think just being able to pick up on programming, which I've never done before to being able to write small javascript games in the browser does make me feel confident about my abilities.

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?
In the same vein I did struggle a lot on stretch goals and making seemingly simple functionalities work and it did make me doubt my ability to do this, but hopefully it does get easier as I learn 
the skills necessary to troubleshoot issues and improve myself.

### Was Foundations what you expected it to be like? If not, what was different?
It was definitely similar to what I expected in terms of workload, and a lot of reading involved as well but didn't expect to have so much stretch goals to further test my skills as well and 
I was pleasantly surprised.

### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?
A couple times, especially during the start of challenges where I didn't really know what to do. What kept me going however was taking a step back and breaking it down into small, more manageable
bits so I didn't feel overwhelmed about everything that was going on.



### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?
I do feel ready about what's to come, even though I don't really know what it's going to be like exactly I am excited to finally meet the other students and concentrate on learning as much as 
I can and making a name for myself in this industry.

### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?
It would probably say not to give up, and that it'll be all worth it at the end of the tunnel!



### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?
I still feel like a student at this point rather than a programmer, but hopefully at the end of bootcamp I'll feel confident enough about my skills to truly say that I'm a programmer ahah
