# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?
I felt pretty confident as most of the learning competencies seemed to be focused on a broader understanding rather than specific topics. The material provided did also give me enough room to learn about new possibilities and provide room for my own research too.


### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?
Honestly, being able to write some rudimentary HTML and CSS for the webpage made me feel pretty capable, even though I struggled to start and didn't know what to really put onto my site, but I also appreciated how freeform it was and ended up with a pretty passable site I'd reckon.


### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?
The adding HTML and CSS to my blog did make me feel stumped to begin with for sure, and I was anxious that I would not be able to come up with something that would touch all the competencies. I did recollect myself however and told myself that this was just a learning excercise and that the design did not matter in the end. I also felt a bit anxious about the JavaScript primer as well, as I had little to no knowledge of that but I do hope that with time that I could pick up all the little tips and tricks of how to write good code and make my page as good as possible.


### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?
Having a more critical eye on designs and layout being an artist myself, I was very picky of how I wanted my site to look and feeling a bit frustrated at how little I knew to make a site look good. I knew what kind of designs and features I wanted and yet I didn't really know how to get them working. I did tell myself that I was still learning however and that I shouldn't be too obssessed over things like that.


### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?
I would say that the most important bit is knowing what you want the site to be for. Then you can think about the general layout, then start off with an initial landing page then branch off from there. HTML is the base information you'll need to make the site work, however to make it appealing you'll need what's called CSS to section parts off and give it an unique flair. And if you want extra features and movement, you'll need JavaScript to help with that.
