# My Reflections - Sprint Two

# Your Blog 

### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?
I created an index.html which is used to hold all the HTML code for the layout and contents of my webpage. I then created a CSS file to hold information on styling and look of my webpage, and even though there wasn't anything there at the moment I will eventually add more to it to improve the look. I then staged and committed and pushed the updated files to github, where it can be displayed on my page. 


### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?
I feel like I'm definitely staying within the timeboxes at the moment still, will need to still manage better with distractions but I still find myself being able to stay within the recommended times for learning and discovering content.




# Learn HTML and CSS 

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?
I learnt a lot about HTML and CSS in a condensed format, however compared to the learning competencies there was still a few things that I felt like I could stand to learn more about. With regards to lists and tables, there's definitely more that I should brush up on, with things like columns and rows but I will have a look at it and play with it later on my HTML blog


### What are of you proud of from this challenge?
I'm proud that I'm learning about the differences between ID and classes, and also learning a bit about the basics on responsive design. I feel like they're especially important with how many difference devices that people view content on nowadays so having the option to change between how media is displayed is extremely important for accessibility and readability.




# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?
It was definitely a bit hard to follow along and also perform changes on the document, since I wasn't sure what all the different functions were about on the DOM and everything looked rather imposing, but I tried my best to tinker with the different elements on the pages and make different things happen. In terms of limitations I felt rather limited in terms of what I knew but hopefully the knowledge will come with time as well.


### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?
I had some trouble setting up the JS environment for the tutorial, however I tried my best to get it working and it seemed to function as it did in the tutorial video as well. There was also the part about the auditing which is now the "lighhouse report" in modern browsers, but that worked out nicely as well.


### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
All of the tabs are study related at the moment, however I did find myself being distracted by messages from friends on my phone from time to time.


### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.
I went onto a wikipedia page for an understanding of how the different sections worked on the page, and tried editing things like elements and background colors, and also hiding various sections or copying and pasting elements onto different parts of the page.



# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  
Once upon a time, there was a couple who wrote children's books. The husband used to be a librarian and was the story teller, coming up with wonderful stories that captured the hearts of many children and made them envision whimsical and fantastic journies and quests with the tales that he would tell. The wife was the artistic one, and her delightful hand painted sceneries and characters would jot the imagination of even the most dull of minds. Together, the storybooks that they would author and illustrate would inspire children of many generations to come. But basically in this case, HTML is much like the husband's storytelling and CSS is like the wife's illustrations, which paired together to make a wonderful combination.


### Any moments of surprise or joy? 
I was using some sample CSS from another site that I really liked, and seeing how all the different functions worked and figuring out what did what really made me happy as they were all features that I could use later to make my blog even prettier.


### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?
HTML would be much akin to a polar bear, a no-frills apex predator that looks imposing as it is powerful to catch prey and survive, whereas CSS would be akin to a songbird, which used its looks and beautiful voice to find mates and flourish.
