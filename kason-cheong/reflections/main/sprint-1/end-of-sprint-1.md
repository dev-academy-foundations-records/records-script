# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?
I found that with the time tracking tool it was good to push myself to spend more time learning and feel confident that I wasn't spending too much or little time on certain aspects of learning. Though the material is bound to get harder with time, I hope that I can stick close to the given time limits and work to the best of my abilities as well


### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
I was feeling quite confident, I went back and looked at the competencies to check my learning and it ended up being quite straightforward. It would be a good idea to summarize or provide a list of all the learning competencies though however.


### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?
I enjoyed the different tasks that was set out to us and going through the videos on our own time and being allowed to explore a bit. 


### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
I did find that a lot of the information given seemed a bit overwhelming at time, but I'm sure that most of them are quite similar and the resources are always there for us to use should we need it.


### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
I sometimes felt like I was being too easy on myself, that I was not working hard enough but I'm sure that as the various tasks come to me as well that I will be able to pick up different things to supplement my own learning and work through assignments.
