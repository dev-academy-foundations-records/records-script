# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
A command line is where you input instructions into, to make your terminal or computer perform what you want it to do. For example it's like a vending machine, where you have different options to choose from, and when you press a button it gives you a product of your choosing.


### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
I used the timebox as a guideline on how much time I spent on learning the different commands, it was very helpeful to have something that I could leave on the side and use as a tracking tool. I'll try to stick to the total recommended amount of time next time.



### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1. cd - this changed the directory, to either a sub directory or could be used to go to the parent directory
2. rm - this removed files, if appended with -r it could be used to remove entire directories as well
3. mv - this can be used to rename files
4. cp - this can be used to copy files or directories 
5. ls - this is used to list everything in a folder, including directories and folders. can be appended with -al for extra details on everything including date modified.


### Did you learn anything unexpected?
I was a complete beginner to the command line so everything was new to me. I will need to keep working hard to remember at least the basic commands and print out the cheat sheet to have it handy.


# Version Control with Git 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?
git is more of a local way to control and modify files on a computer or system, whereas github is an online platform to host files that have been uploaded from git or to get files that have been hosted.


### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
it would be akin to a sheet music website; where musicians can upload their own sheet music to the site but also get sheet music from other people and make their own version of it then upload it, and the site would be a place where everyone could browse and make changes independently.


### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
no, so i think i will keep the videos and notes i have made handy and give myself some time to go back and play around in the terminal to refresh my memory.


### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
i did well in sticking to the timebox, i definitely need more time to learn all the different commands but i did manage to spend the time to watch through the videos provided and have a very basic and rough idea of the different things i could do with git.


# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a Git workflow?
The process of making changes or creating files then adding them to the staging, then commmiting them to the updated git file to make sure that all changes are properly documented. Individual changes should have individual commits to make it easy to locate bugs or changes. 
	git add .
	git status (to check what was added to the staging or what still needs to be added)
	git commit -m "[commit message]" (the commit message should be concise in terms of the changes made, if -m 	is omitted the code studio will open up and prompt you to write in a commit message)
	git push (to add the changes to github)


### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
When I was feeling a bit confused by an idea I went ahead and tried changes to the files myself to see if it was the way something was meant to be done. 


### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
I would definitely try to make more notes of ideas or concepts that I was unsure on. 


# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?
it would be akin to making save points in a video game, where you might be fighting a boss and when you lose, you can go back to a save point and see if you can change your equipment or strategy and win. For example, the final loadout that you might decide to go with (the stage) will be saved (commit) before you attempt to fight the boss again.


# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?
The main is where the most stable and robust version of the code exists, whether locally or remotely. It should be the most ideal version of the code and should always be working or running correctly.


### Why create a Branch?
 A branch is an independent stage of development based off the main, used to either test a new feature, fix code or bugs, or simply used to experiment with certain things. By creating a branch we can allow room for error without making changes to the main copy of the project and also allow for pull requests to review code before it is added back into the main branch. 


### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?  
There does feel like there's a lot of small features within the main ones introduced in these tutorials that feels a lot more harder to grasp, but otherwise I don't feel like the concepts are particularly hard to understand. I think the main issue would be trying to recall a command used to achieve a certain task.


# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?
For example, when you have an open source version of a code that you want to tinker around and make your own version of without pushing to the main or if you do not have permission to change the files on main, a fork is a great idea to get an entire copy without messing up the original.



### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?
No yet, as all the features in git seem quite intuitive and I think for me it boils down to remembering all the different options available to me to achieve the function I want.


# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?
I was still a bit unfamiliar with all the different options available to me, especially with all the different options and settings that came up to me when I first started a repo, however, the basic functions such as cloning and creating files, then adding them to the stage and committing it with a message, then pushing it to github I am getting the hang of. 


### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?
I always thought the whole idea of website hosting was convoluted, in terms of designing something before putting it on a web host, however looking at it through git hub made me realize how easy it was to get a simple website running like that. All you really need is a text file to define some values as a webpage and it can be run just like that. 




# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?
 When I first encounter problems, I think about what I am trying to achieve and what I have so far. I then try to break the problem down into root issues that I think is causing the issue, and check my resources on what might solve the issue, be it documentation or google. I do so by using keywords based on the issue I am encountering, and if not I do the same for the intended result that I am trying to achieve. I then use the solutions or information that I have gathered to solve my own issue, or make a formulated attempt at solving the issue myself.




# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 
It was definitely hard trying to pick some words or values to describe myself, but I found it easier to do it in text instead of in person where it can be quite easy to stumble on words or find the right things to say.


### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 
I definitely feel humbled seeing all the different students from all walks of life trying out something new for themselves as well, and all the introductions made me feel right in place even though I'm completely new to a subject like this. I hope that in due time that I can feel proud of myself when I look back on all this and realize how far I've come.
