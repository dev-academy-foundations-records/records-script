  <p style="font-size:25px;" class="'intro">This webpage has been designed and edited to record my foundation learning journey with Devacademy.<br>
  The foundation study will be focus on two part. This is a bootcamp about coding, so Tech is no doubt the first part, which will display my knowledge about coding. <br>
  While, the second part is core, in which I will present the journey of self exploration. It involves my value, strengths, motivations etc.
