      <ol>
        <li class="question">What is Javascript and it's relationship to HTML and CSS?</li>
        <p class="para">
          Javascript is a language that make the webpage with HTML and CSS interactable with users, 
          as HTML mark up the webpage and CSS make the webpage stylish with font and images etc., 
          while Javascript enhances the user experiences by creating animated graphics, updating 
          informations, making interactive map etc.
        </p>
       
        <p class="para">
          Too complicated to understand? Consider HTML and CSS are bones, veins, skin, eyes with 
          green pupil, while Javascript is like endocrine system, which secrete hormones to adjust 
          moods like happiness, and the brain and that give order to human body to execute action.
           With brian and endocrine system control the behaviour of humanbeings, people can interact 
           and build relationship with each others  
        </p>
        <li class="question">What is 'Control Flow' and 'Loops'?</li>
        <p class="para">
          The way comupter runcode in Javascript is called Control flow, it usually runs code from 
          first line and ends at the last line. Some statement can interrupt and change the Control
          Flow. Loops is one of them. if run Loops statement, the code will keep running until the 
          loops over or webpage breakdown to false. The syntax of 'for loop' is shown below:
        </p>
        <img class="responsive-pics" src="../pics/for loop.webp">
        <p class="para">An analogy of 'control flow' and 'loop' can be seen as an old-school Sony Walkman, without 
          any interruption, the tape will be played through, once listners want to hear one song over 
          and over again, they will loop part of the tape and repeat as many time as they want until 
          the battery go flat.
        </p>
        <li class="question">What is DOM, and give an example how to interact with it?</li>
        <p class="para">
          The DOM represents Document Object Model. The DOM is created by browser when a webpage is 
          loaded, the browser represnets  the inside of webpage. HTML DOM is created as a tree of Objects, 
          every object in the the DOM is listed in hierarchical way. 
        </p>
        <img class="responsive-pics" src="../pics/DOM tree.png"> 
        <p class="para">
          Using DOM allows programmer create, change, remove elements from the document. Whatsmore, 
          it can add events to the elements, creating more dynamic webpage to enhance user's experiences.
        </p>
        <p class="para">The example how to interact with DOM</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="question">select the certain "id", "elements" or "class"by using</li>
          <p class="para">document.getElementById("id-name")</p>
          <p class="para">documnet.querySelector("Element-name")</p>
        
          <li class="question">then add prooerties like "innerHTML" to modified selected elements</li>
          <p class="para">document.getElementById("id-name").style,color = "choose a color",  this will change the color of selected ID</p>
          <p class="para">documnet.querySelector("Element-name").innerHTML="new text", this will add new text to the HTML elements</p>
        </ul>


        <li class="question">Explain the differences between assessing an 'Array' and 'Object'.</li>
        <p class="para">
          Aryy is a list of things for example: arr['a','b','c','d'], which is a container to contain "a","b", "c","d" 
          Four elements. When computer reads the code, it starts for 0. Hence, to assess the first element "a", 
          use code arr(0) and to assess last element "d" use code arr(3) 
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          While we can define an object with multiple values, for example: const Kurt ={firstName:'Kurt', 
          lastName:'Liang',hairColour:'black',age:'31'} when assessing the object "kurt" simplely type kurt 
          or console.log(car), to assess the value of kurt type kurt.age to fetch "31" 
        </p>
        <li class="question">What are functions and why are they useful?</li>
        <p class="para">Functions are blocks of codes, they are designed to execute particular tasks.</p>
          <p class="para">To define a function use the syntax: </p>
            <p class="code">function function_name(list_of_parameters)

            {
            
            //JavaScript statements
            
            }</p>
        
        <p class="para">
          To execute a function is defined as calling the function. A fucntion can be called as many 
          time as you want to do tricks on webpages, with amount of small functions working together, 
          the programme can achiene complecated task.
