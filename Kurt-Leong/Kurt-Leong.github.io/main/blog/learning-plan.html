        <li class="question">My long term goal and my career path way</li>
        <p class="para">
         I see Javascript as my first coding language, my long term goal would be study other different languages, 
         which will help me to tackle different challenges in the work. In terms of career path, I am aiming to be a 
         part of a tech team, working collabrately with other to finish projects, and I hope one day I am able to lead 
         a team to provide services for different grouos.

        </p>
        <li class="question">My biggest strengths and limitations in Bootcamp/li>
          <p class="para">
            I communicate better through face to face rather than online through discord or zoom, I see it as my biggest strength, I believe I am more willing 
            to ask question, to express myself when face to face. My limitation would be my tech-skills, I can imaging some frustrating situations when I am 
            a driver paring programming with my parter. Another limitation I realised that I have is I am not seeking for perfection, I some time accidently 
            solve some bugs after spent huge amount of time. At that point I just felt I had enough of that, and I will skip it now and come back later to get 
            it understand, the result is I may never come back to it. I realised it now, so next week I will go review the exercise I did through foundation.
            During Bootcamp, I understand it will be intense, I need learn lots of thing in short time, I do need find some time to go over some knowlege again
            an again.
          </p>
        <li class="question">My biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp</li>
        <p class="para">
         The one I can think of now is find time for myself to have break, when I get stuck I do not want to have a break until I solved problem, even when I have had 
         to have a break, my mind cannot fully get away from it, I can not get myself out doing other things. I am thinking to go the CrossFit at NewMarket when doing
         bootcamp, I know doing exercise will help me coding better, but I am still worried about that I may stick on the problem, not giving myself breaks, as this is 
         what I sometimes do during foundation.
        </p>
        <li class="question">The non-technical skills and human skill I would like to develop during the Bootcamp</li>
        <p class="para">I would like to see my leadership develop in bootcamp, I acctualy do not know how to achieve it, as I believe leadership sometimes is highly related with professional
          knowledge, it require decision making, involving everyones idea. I may do good to listen everyone's voice, but I still need strong tech knowledge to
          help me make decision.
        </p>
        <li class="question">My expectations for the Bootcamp team</li>
        <p class="para">I hope bootcamp team can guide me when I am wrong, , encourage me to keep trying when I did not try enough, but remind me when I need a break.</p>
        <li class="question">My expectation about myself during the Bootcamp</li>
        <p class="para">
        I wish I can balance my study and life, study well and rest well, when achieving at Bootcamp, still caring about mental and physical wellbeing of myself and others.

    <h1 class="header">My Learning Plan For The Next Stage</h1>
     <i>created on 14th Jan 2023</i>
     <ol>
      <li class="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>
        <p  class="para">1. At this stage, my first goal after graduation is to find the junior front-end designer position. Learning with EDA is my first time step into Tech area, and there are lots  of things that I do not know, I can’t say what my ultimate goal is. What I know is that it is an ongoing journey, there are always something new coming out from the industry, to keeping learning and tackle more new challenges.</p>
      <li class="question">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</li>
      <p  class="para">2. My biggest strengths is persistence and resilience. If I commit to complete tasks or goals, I try my best to do it. For this learning, I encountered few challenges, and I overcome them through my persistent research and practice. Sometimes being over persistent can limit my study, I found when I explore CSS, I sort of dive too deep and spent extra time on the concepts that I do not need at this stage. This will make my study inefficiency. To solve this, I should keep using the Toggl to track my time, so I don’t  spend too much time going off track.
      </p>
      <li class="question">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
      <p  class="para"> am looking to see my leadership and cooperation skill to be improved, through this programme I realised that when doing projects, individual’s effort is limited, that is why we use tool like git and Github, which required people communicate a lot and cooperate with each other, so they can work towards the same goal. I am looking forward to seeing these ability to be challenged and improved. </p>
      <li class="question">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</li>
          <ul>
            <li class="question">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
            <li class="question" v>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p  class="para"> In order to work productively and safely, I need to raise good working habit and regular routines. To achieve this, making  the most use of timebox tool like Toggl and Pomodoro. Coding is about understand the logic of syntax, so the more I practice, the better I will be. I will commit to code everyday, or code in my mind everyday, if not allowed to enhance this skill. Regularly reflect about the thing I learnt is also essential, I can conclude the reason from failures or refine better methods to tackle problems through regular reflection. To get ready to accept challenges daily, I need get our physical and mental wellness it to a sound situation, sleeping well, eating healthy and regularly doing exercise. This not only help us survive in the overwhelming tasks, and it can keep me thinking positive, so toxic feeling is not dragging me or my team’s leg.</p>
          <p class="para">My way of clear my mind, when I get stuck, is doing exercise or having meditation. Either sweating or calm myself down will reboot my brain. And when I come back to review the problem, I regained energy and may have new idea to solve it.</p>
          <li class="question">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
      <p  class="para">When I get tangled in mind, the first thing I would do is to get things clear for myself, writing a log to present what I am trying to achieve, what have I done, what was the result, any other effort I have tried. I cannot reach out for help if I cannot describe what got me. After I understand how I get stuck, I will turn to the Discord search if anyone had same problem before, if not, I would go to google or other forum to search it. At this stage I should have read or watch many extra materials, I should set a deadline, at a certain point, I should go ask help from facilitators or peers if I did not make any improvements.</p>
      <p  class="para"></p>
      <li class="question">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</li><p  class="para">6. I am expecting the facilitator to see my sprint work thoroughly, and give constructive feedback. Let me know If I am off the track, and how can work towards the right direction. I see facilitator team as guide through the study, and all the study should be actively completed by myself.</p>
      <li class="question">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</li>
      <p  class="para">7. I need to relocate at the beginning of the Feb, I am trying to go ahead of foundations course.</p>
