  <h1 class="header">Identiy, Value and Strength</h1>


  <ol class="questions" type="1">
    <li class="question">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</li>
    <p class="para">My work requires first aid certificate, it was the time I had few weeks left to leave my position and move back to Auckland. But my first aid certificate would be expired before I leave. My employer arranged a first aid training and they would pay for all the employees. I felt that I am not working with them anymore, and I shoud not take advantages from them, taking the free frist aid training.
       Hence I insisted to pay the training by myself. In this case, even though I did not have many days left at work and I may not need first aid certificate anymore, I still pay myself to be eligible working as a qualified teacher.  </p>
    <li class="question">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</li>
    <p class="para">I was born and grown up in Wuhan, the city was not a world-widly known city before the outbreak of COVID-19, I have never lived in other places except my home town before 25. 
      Before I coming to New Zealand, my mother is the most influencing person for me. Most of my generation in China grew up in the concrete jungle, 
      and we barely have chances to explore the nature. My mom, she is a truly explorer and adventurer, who introduced camping and tramping to me. While my friends were playing video games
    and hanging out in the Karaoke, I spent quite a few time outdoors, seeing different people. I believed how I had been treated
  during my journeys by those strangers and travller had formed my way of treating others, with kindness and integrity.     </p>
    <li class="question">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</li>
    <p  class="para">I see resiliance,patience and the ability to be aware of my emotions as my great strenghths, I have been told this will be a challenging journey, lots of failures feeling frustrated. 
      I believe smartness will not be the vital key to overcome it. I can see when I run my code and fail from time to time, I need to deal with my emotions that may hold me down. Another strenghs I value 
      myself is the communication, I know I do not reach out online a lots. I intend to seek help face to face and  from closed friends. but according my experiences work as a leader in my teachers' team, I 
      am very positive that I will continue improving my communication skills through online.
    </p>
    <li class="question">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</li>
    <p  class="para">As I narratived, I intended to seek help from closed friends, I may have the conlusion that I ask help from people after I built relationship with them. For the foundation part, I had few 
      frustrating situations and I can see more coming, I know the best the way is to seek help through Discord. It turned out that I would rather spend more time to solve them by myself or ask my friends, since I can hardly build relationship with people online.
      This really slows me down. This is for study. While for my future career, I was expected to work with different kind of people, and customers, with my slow-warm-up personality online, I can see the challenges that I need to overcome in the future.</p>
    <li class="question">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</li>
    <p  class="para">I have been working as leader in my teachers' team in early childhood education centre, we have daily task to do to apply with the policy. Most of the team memeber will follow up and take their initiaty to take part of the responsibility.
      we had few occasion that the some team member is slacking and not contributing. I do not like tell people what to do, so most of time I will be role modeling take the most cumbersome work, and let the member choose a task to finish from the rest of them.
      It seems not a sound way, after consulting my manager and do some reflection, if similar situation happen, I would open up the question, tell them what did I see, and ask them what can they do and how can I assist them.
