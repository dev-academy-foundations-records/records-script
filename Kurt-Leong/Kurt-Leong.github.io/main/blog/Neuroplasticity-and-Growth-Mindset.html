        It is a recently new concept, as before, public believe brain is static after it grew. While new resarchs believe that the brain is malleable, the 
        more individual uses the brain, stronger the conections between the neural cells are. Oppositely, lack of using specific part of brain shows the neural
        conection decline. This phenomenon can be seen when people experiences new things or to adapt environmental changes 
        This reorganising an restructuring in brain is called neuroplasticity
