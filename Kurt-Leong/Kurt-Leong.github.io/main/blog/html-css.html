      <p class="para"> Both inline and inline-block have the functions to adjust the elements in the layout of the website. While this blog will explain the use of inline and inline-block, and the differences between.</p>
     <p class="para">Inline allow the elements stay in the same line, instead of pushing the element to the lines above or under, elements set as inline only take the space of the contents, which means they igonre the height and weidth properties.
    change the size of viewport will automatically wrap the text with inline value. See example below:</p>

    <div>
      <p class="block">This is a block1</p>
      <p class="block">This is a block2</p>
      <p class="block">This is a block3</p>
    </div>
    
  <p class="para">The screen shots shows the HTML and CSS code of the above contents:</p>

  <img class="block-pics" src="../pics/html code.png" alt="html code">
  <img class="block-pics" src="../pics/css code.png" alt="css code">

  <p class="para">
    As we can see, inline value allow the elements sit together in the same line, and only take the space  three blocks with inline value were set both height and width 1000px, 
    but it does not show on the Website. When you adjust the viewport, the blocks who take the whole line will be pushed to next line. The contents be pushed to the next line has the height of the Text.
  </p>
    
  <p class="para">In terms of inline-block, it blends some of the functions from both inline and block. Which means It will display as inline value, allowing elements sit together, but the height and width of the elements are not defaut size of Text. We can adjust height and width of element as much as we want. Blow screen shot the heigth and width were both set 10px, so the txet came out of the border.

  </p>

  <div>
    <p class="block1">This is a block4</p>
    <p class="block1">This is a block5</p>
    <p class="block1">This is a block6</p>
  </div>
  
  
  <p class="para">The replacement element like image elemets automatically have the display value in line, which means they will take a whole line by  default, however, they will take width and height value. 
      so for image the inline and inline block have no differences.</p>
