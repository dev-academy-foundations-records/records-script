  <h2>When I get blocked by a simple problem</h2>
    <p class="para">
      When I looked at Manuipulating Objects, I was thinking, wow that is looks easy. I clearly remebered I haved watched someone 
      code this task before, I was relaxed, decided to make myself a coffee before started it, confidently thinking that I could 
      nail this and maybe next kata challenge before lunch. I went through all the way to step 7, all is good. Starting from step 8,
      the task asked me to add a property-1 as a value of another main property-2, and property-1 should have specfic key and contain
      a value. The confidence I had built from the first 7 steps just callapsed. What is the task asking to do? I read the requirement 
      over over and over again, I started doubt about my English, does my english limit me understanding those words?
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      I get a little bit anoyed, tried to recall what did Joseph do in the lecture. Seeing from here, the moment I wrote these words down
      I probably did the most stupid thing since I started the foundation, I started the coding without fully understand the quetiosn. It 
      was nearly Lunch time, and I tried different way that everytime, when I ran the test I spoke to myself:"This time will definetly pass".
      But it would not go as I expected, I started pulling my hair, which does not have much left. In the next 10 minutes, I skiped between 
      the webpages from MDN and Web3Schools, tried to figured it out if I opened everything I need for this task. I realised that this is 
      not helping at all.  My flatmates asked me to have lunch together when they saw me got this frustrated. Fine, based on my previous 
      experiences, this might be a good idea.  
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      During the meal, I kept thinking about the task, and the food taste nothing to me. Not pleasant, I started question myself why I am 
      doing this. I was luck that my flatmates are tech people, but I was to shame to ask them simple question like this. They told me that
      they suffered this when they started, and they offered help. I really appreciate the way they guide me, they asked me to read the 
      requirement thorouphlly, and I decide to start from the beginning again, read guideline from EDA handbook, and found the handbook 
      provided definetion about what Object, property, key and values are, and this is what got stucked so long - not fully understand the 
      requirement. After knowing that, the task became easy, I wrote it out, but my way of doing is cumbersom, when the task asked me to add
      second and thrid property to the the main property, I needed to re-writed the frist code again. At this point I already run out my patiece 
      and I left behind, and started to doing next. Fortunately, Jared markedthe wrong task and he accidently found this repeated code, so a 
      smart way was sent with feedback to helped me shorten the code when I was stuck on the gradebook task.
    </p>
    
    <p class="para">
    What I leart from this tiny problem, is that alway get to know what I wanted to do before start coding. If I was confused the basic concepts 
    and could not figured out the goal I wanted achieve, I will never reach the gaol.
    </p>
    <h2>How did I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
    <p class="para">
      I fail a lots and achieved a lot and  one by one, the last kata before strechs came through, which is 'deBuzz'. I already gained a few methods
      that can be used to tackle the problem. Before I started the task I wrote a pseudocode:
      <ol>
        <li class="question">use 'split' to break the string into array</li>
        <li class="question">find 'buzz' out by using filter </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="para">
      when I reached this point, I found that I could not select and remove the words with capital words inside. I noticed that mates in Discord have
      discussed this before, so I went to check the reference, and it truely gave the solution, using toLowerCase() or toUperCase() to compared to buzz
      or BUZZ if element is not equal returning true, in this way, the code can select and remove the buzz out. 
    </p>

    <p class="para">
      Compared to other kata challenge, I felt smooth when I tackle this 'deBuzz' problem, this was first time I guess, I could feel the flow, and it 
      was a really nice feeling, I guess.
    </p>
    <h1>How confident do I feel using each of these problem-solving techniques:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="question">Pesudocode</li>
      <p class="para">
        During this sprint, I inplement Pesudocode to all of my task, I can get most of logic right.
      </p>
      <li class="question">Trying something</li>
      <p class="para">
        I tried differnet way to tackle the same problem, and when I get blocked in a way, I tried to find out other ways like: can I 
        use forEach to solve this problem? is there any other way that I can use? I find out the more I get stuck and the more Research
        I did, I am able to gain more methods that I can use to tackle different problem.
      </p>
      <li class="question">Rubber ducky method</li>
      <p class="para">
        I felt like Rubber ducky method is similar to Pseudocode, and instead of talking to a duck, I usually write down what did. It is 
        more clear for me, as I can visualise what did I do.
      </p>
    
      <li class="question">Reading error messages</li>
      <p class="para">
        Every time I got my test fail, I will read the error message, and it is helpful for me to debug.
      </p>
      <li class="question">Console.logging</li>
      <p class="para">
          I would say console.log is my priority method to tackle the problem, since the Gradebook kata, I console.log almost every line 
          to see if the code is doing what I am expecting it to do.
      </p>
      <li class="question">Googling</li>
      <p class="para">
        where I take my words about console.log back, discribe the problem and search how do I achieve this is the thing I have done thousand
        time a day. 
      </p>
      <li class="question">Asking your peers for help</li>
      <p class="para">
        I still hinder to ask question in Discord, first I am really slow, I can see peers asked similar question in the group and usually it 
        provides enough info for me to solve the problem.
      </p>
      <li class="question">Asking coaches for help</li>
      <p class="para">
        to be honest, I have not asked coach question privatly, I only asked few questions when having home group meeting.
      </p>
      <li class="question">Improving your process with reflection</li>
      <p class="para">
        except write the reflection provided from EDA, I sometime just do quick mind reflection, which help me to refine my
        way to solve the problem and start thinking and acting like a programmer. 
      </p>
