 # My Reflections - Sprint Two

# Your Blog 

### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?

In the first exercise of sprint-2, I created a block directory in my kurt-leong.github.io repo and created HTML file, which allows me to put words and edit it in my website. Then I made another directory named styles, which will store .css file. the .css file will control the style, like font, color, etc after you link this .css file to the .HTML file. In this exercise, I did not edit any style, so when opening the HTML file, you can only see plain words, which describes the legend story of te houtaewa.

### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?
I opened toggl, start tracking HTML and CSS setup, then I decided to go back to the upstream subtitle to check how the whole sprint 2 is structured, I remember to paused the Toggle this time, and went through the structure. This time is good, I started it again when I continute this task. By the time, I typed these words down, the Toggle marked sharp 50:00.




# Learn HTML and CSS 

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?

When I study the section Create a Set of Radio Buttons at freecodecamp, I believe the course first time narratives creating "for" attribute for the <label> elent which can match with the "id" attribut of the <input> element. It did not make any sense for, at first place. I was quite anxious and frustrated that I could not understand it. I acctually leave behind, when I study further, those elements and attributes shows more frequently, I was getting better understanding through the process. It just took patience, the more I explore, the better understanding I have for the abstract concept. It reminds me the first sprint-1, neuroplastic, and I know that what I need is to invest more time to help my brain think like a programmer.


### What are of you proud of from this challenge?

I pround of that I made this far, before I joined with EDA, I had a few online courses. I started a lots, but I barely finished them. Through the first two sections of sprint-2, I did something I have never done before, and it really gives me tremendous confidence.



# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?

For this part, I read carefully about the Learning Competencies in the handbook, I focus more on how much did I learn intead of how much I do not understand. when I finish the interactive study, I went back to check the Learning Competencies to check how my learning was going. In this section, I realize that, I cannot study all the things at once. it is a journey, and it is just beginning.

### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?

The instructor in the clip uses Windows OS, when he created a folder in the Sources tab with the action of clicking right buttom, which I could not do the same in the MacOs Chrome, I paused the video, and tried different way in the DevTool, and figured the MacOS-way out. There are some other contents that relatetd to Javascrpt I could not follow, and the last part of clip talked about the Audit tab (whcih I could not find in my DevTools). I was not borthered, I just leave them behind, and believe that I will encounter them and understand or solve it in the furture.

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

I read this reflection questions before started this section, so I closed most of non-related tabs, it turns out this section was quite efficient. 
### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.

I changed my deposit in the bank account. well not officially

# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  
So a Producers and a Director want to release a stage show at the CIVIC, so they hire a bunch of actors and actress from HTML.co and they also hire some makeup artists, those makeup artists uses cosmetics and some tools called Font-color, font-family and Font-size to change the appearances of those actors and actress, so their apperance start looking like the characters from the script. The producers and Directors tell the actors and actress how to act and where to go. Also, they hire some stage desinger, to make the stage more vivid. With all these people working together, they practice many times to make the show more harmonious, here comes a new show at Auckland.


### Any moments of surprise or joy? 
 I was definetly missed in the rabbit hole when I explored about the the CSS, there are lots of things I want to achieve by using CSS. I would say the experiences using freecodecamp to study was enjoyable. But when I put them into practice, I got lost, I litterally did not know how should I achieve them. I felt really anxcious when I saw my peers' fancy website, and asking myself what am I gonna do for my own blog. Iwas researching the layout and all the function that can make my blog look betterï¼Œ and I fell far behind. Untill now Saturday morning, I still got some tasks to do before deadline. I realised I need to jump out, I only  need to check if I finished learning competencies. To be honest, this part, I got more frustration  than the joy.

### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?
I would say HTML is like sheep in the farm, it is basic thing to tell people, well it is a farm (Website), it got sheep (information) inside. While CSS is like border collie (ther herding dog), with the herding dog you control where those sheep go. With CSS, coder can manipulate the text information on the website.
