# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?
I felt confident for most part of the study, except the section, link HTML to the CSS file. It takes me a while to understand the syntax and how each values affect each other. 



### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?
I really like the part study with Freecodecamp, follow the instruction, I slowly built up a website that I never thought I could. Although afterwards the hard time came when exploring the CSS by on my own blog.


### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?
When I was asked to add HTML & CSS to my Blog, I do have a picture in my mind how my blog looks like, but when I put CSS into practice, I just do not know where to start. I lost count how much time did I spend exloring this part with very limited improvment.


### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?
When I spent too much time off track about CSS, some mates already post their blog in the Discord, compared to my own messed-up blog, I kept asking myself, what I have done. I realise I went far off from the track, from this point, I went back to check the learning competencies, and pull myself back to the right track on time.


### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?
use the HTML to edit the content of the website, after you put the content into the website. Another tool called CSS were applied to change the look of the website e.g. font-size font-family etc.
