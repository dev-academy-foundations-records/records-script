# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?

Command line or Terminal is an application that you can access, make changes, delete, create etc. to your files in the computer by typing command instead of using G.U.I (Graphical User Interface). It is like chat room that you can chat with your computer and command it to do the task, but you need to learn the language that the computer use.


### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

If the task is short, I was very likely to follow the timebox, however, if the it is a task takes more than one hour, and when I get interrupted, and I forget to stop the toggl, and the time I used for that task seems not accurate. I should more frequently use the toggl, the more I use the better I can track my time. And I was thinking to combine toggle with pomodoro together every time the pomodoro finish, I should also open the toggl to stop the time tracking.

### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1.cd : go directory in local computer.
2.open : open files
3.touch : create new files
4.rm -rf : delete files
5.mv : re-name the file


### Did you learn anything unexpected?

When I learnt how to open VS code from terminal, I followed the instruction, but it shows "permission denied". So I put this result in google, and found out I need to choose Shell Command: Uninstall 'code' command in PATH first and then install again.

# Version Control with Git 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is a local application that in the users computers allow users manage and keep track the source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service manage Git repositories, and users can use Github to cooperate with others to do the project with clear working log that contains all the changes information. 


### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?

It is like big storage room that have many workers and statistician inside, every time a worker puts something new inside or takes something out the auditor will record the time, the name of work and the amount of change. So people can clearly know what are inside the storage rom.

### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?

If I can use Github and Git daily, and every time I practise, I can think of the theory  behind it, I believe I can still remember the differences.

### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

Yes for this part

# Install and Explore Git

### What is a Git workflow?

Git workflow is system of working method that a group of developer commit to use same way to complete the tasks, it includes making modiffcaiton to their own branch and saving the changes by committing to it and push it to GitHub server. Different people can work on different branches without affecting the main branch and if checking the modifications are benefitial, developer can pull to the main branch, progressing the project.


### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

I found the study is challenging, I did not fully prepared for the study, so I am still try to balance the life and study. I started very slow, so when I see my peers are ways ahead of me, I felt very anxious. Howeverï¼Œ I really like the phase in reading like get into flow and how to use timebox, it really helped me to get into the zone, and forget about I am behind others. What is more important is it helped me to realise that this study is all about improving myself instead of competing with others. When I get confused and block I would go to Discord to see if anyone brought it up before, and see how other people solve it. If it is not in discord, I would google it, and I found that I prefer watching video to help me understand some concepts or solve the problem.

### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?

As I said, I prefer study through learning, I think the first video in Tech covers most contents, and the subtitle contents elaborate more details. I would go over the video see which part is my weakness, and go directly to the weak part to strengthen it.

# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?

I would say, staging is making modification to the duplicate files or add new files to the copied folder, and committing is to save those modifications.

# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?

Main branch is also knonw as master, it is like a trunk of the trees, it is also the initial branch when you clone from github.

### Why create a Branch?

people can work on different branches without affecting the master branch. Through this, developers can test their new idea, and avoding to crash the main branch, if their fail, they can go back to the main branch start over again.

### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?  

Yes some of they took me a while to understand, I found it is easier for me to understand some concepts through watching clips rather than reading. But I tried to read first and when I really get stucked I would go watch a related clip.

# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?

When a project is a open source to the public, and developers wants try new stuff to the repo, they can fork the repo and make modification without the original owner's permission. If the modifications look positive thay can send a pull request to the owner to make finnal commit.


### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

I was so confused about branching and forking, what differences? until I heard the words, forking allow development to have different autority to the repo, while when you are using other's repo and want to push the change from your branch to the main, you may not have the permision, while you can push if you are forking, as it is your own repository.

# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?

My username is Kurt-leong, when I follow the instruction to create a new repo with name kurtleong.github.io, everything looks good, but when I arriced the final step, go to kurtliang.github.io in the browser, turns out 404 not fund. I recheck twice, and could not figure it out. I did not think of the repo name can make difference, as the picture in the instruction did not show this. I read the caption that github may take 15 mins to build it up. While waiiting I felt like it may caused by the repo name, and I tried it out. I do not have otehr frustration other than that.

### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?

I did not think that build up a basic website would be this easy, I over immagine that build one require lots of designing skill to make it look fancy and need lots of coding skill to make links work.



# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?

Through spirnt 1, I didnot seek help from discord quite often, I found through checking history threads, goolge the problem can solve most of the promplem. I think for me the most important thing to tackle the challenging is to not get frustrated, and when feeling tired, go have rest, and the problem will be solved like a flow.



# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 

 It was easy to talk about my basic information, when it comes to values and my identity, I took awhile to think how should I word it. It was hard to find precise adjective to describe myself, and when I chose one, I kept asking myself, "Am I really like this, it is too much for me". So I went back to think about some conversations I had with my friends. pick few words that how they describe me, it did not seem quite right for me. 

### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 

No I do not think so, I tried to be humble modest and honest and avoid overusing words to describe myself.
