# Final Reflections - Sprint Four 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I would say 50%, this week I was still busy with my final settlment in Auckland, it seems that I finished work, but I know my skill
and knowledge is not solid enough
### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?

The only kata exercise  I figured it out by using different tools and techniques is 'deBuzz', and that is the only moment I felt a
sense if achievement.

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?

most kata exercises made me think this way, and sometime, when I do online lecture, I felt like my facilitator is speaking anotehr language,
sometime I would take me extra time to follow up and understand what are other people talking about.

### How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?

As this week I am multi-task coding and relocating, I really did not have much time to do such thing, I will reward myself next week

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say? 
well, relocating this week is not a good idea, but hanging up there, you will get there, soon or late.
