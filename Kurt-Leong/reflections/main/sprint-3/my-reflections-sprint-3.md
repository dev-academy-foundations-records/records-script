# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness 

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

When I was in Early Childhood sector, It is quite popular to practice mindfulness in daily practice. There can be lots of unexpected situation during the workflow. With lots distraction and interruptions happen around you, tt is quite important to notice what was I doing, what am I doing now, What am I going to do, otherwise it is really common to feel I have done nothing today. I am quite happy to see I am expected to keep practicing mindfullness other than Education Sector.
### How did you find the overall experience? 

I have been practiced mindfullness years ago. For some reasons, I have stoped doing it for a while. I do really like the feeling that I am able to notice what my brain is doing and what it is capleble to do.

### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness? 
    
I will start practising mindfullnessfrom small things again, doing daily chores and routine once at a time. For example, when eating, doing nothing but eating,hewing food slowly, to sense the texture and flavors of the food, to feel how your body react to different food. When walking, be mindful about the pace you walk, the environment around you, how am I feeling about this walk, am I walking on the hard concrete or soft grass land. Starting from the small things in daily life will contribute to mindfullness when things get complecated.


# Listening and Looping 

### What was it like to be fully listened to? 

 We were given the task to keep talking about 2 minutes without interruption. When I know that there are someone fully listening to my talking, I get really nervous, as I am afraid my speaking may not clear enough for my partner to do the looping, I tried to speak more logical, avoid repeating, I had a few stops, for some part, I felt like I talk about something unecessary to fill up the time.

### What was it like to fully listen?

  When I commit to listen to my classmate's speech, I felt I was more concertate than usual. Everytime I felt the speaker finished one opinion, I consciously made a short summary in my mind, and this does not affect me too much to keep listening to the speaker's talking. The two minutes talk does felt very long, and when he finished talk. I am feeling confident to do the loop, and the feedback from the speaker gave me even more confidence. I felt like this looping and mindful listening is a authentic reciprocal for both speacker and listener, in which way they also strengthen our relationship.





# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?

when I do lots of research by myself, I started with one concepts, and during watch video, I noticed there are loads of new concepts and knowledges are introduced. I was really easily going to the fork road, finally when I realised that I should pull myself out. I ended up no where. This made me really frustrated, and I felt in that period of time I only learnt so little. May be in the future, when I intend to study one concept, I should focuse on it, using different resources (blog video, practice), not change my study goal until I finish the focused one.

### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?
 I had study Javascript from Freecodecamp before the foundation kicked off, I thought this part would be easy for me, but I was wrong. I did not use the Toggl, but I assume my study time was roughly following the timebox. With that amount of time, I have to say, though I finish all the required tasks, but my learinng was still limited





# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?

Coding alone with Joseph is really helpful in way not only gives me a insight of how the codes are working and logic behind it, but also ease my anxiety by telling us the first time he experienced the loop. Through his video, I cannot say I am fully understand how Javascript and the DOM interact, but the way the video demostrated really enhanced my learning, Plus it gives me a lots of confidence.

### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?

There are some codes, when I fisrt saw it, I was freaked out, with exposing myself to it and use it again and again, I can gradually pick it up. So the first thing I leart from this activity is do not stop when you see something scary, carry my quetions and confusedness and keep moving forwards, at some point, I will fully understand it. Another thing I leart from the clip is, when I start a big task, always think about how to break it down to a number of small easy task. Thil can make the work way eaiser.
