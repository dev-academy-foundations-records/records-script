# Final Reflections - Sprint Three 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

Not quite confident if I was asked to do it again without references, I assume that I need keep the habit of coding daily and to review this until I get more confident.

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?

Before the part DOM interaction (to count the different colour dots), I felt it was sooth and easy. 

### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?

When I did the counts colored dot and Javascript cafe projects, my codes gone error millions of time, and when I tried many times, and accidently see someone post in the discord the hint. I felt really bad, but it is upset instead of angry. The upset is about myself, that I did not crack the problem out by myself, I felt like I was cheating on the projects.

### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?
I did not think of giving up, as I quite enjoy the challenging, I know this point I am lack of abilities to solve Tech problems. I often look back, see how much progress did I make, last week I though CSS was difficult, two weeks ago, I never have made a webpage befor. what I thought were unachievable now seems easy to me. I believe someday in the future, those codes that I see very difficult to understand will be like drinking water to me.
