    <h1>EQ vs. IQ</h1>

    <p class="question">What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>

    <p>
      According to Rebecca Joy Stanborough, your emotional quotient (EQ)
      generally refers to your ability to sense emotion in yourself and in other
      people. It also refers to how you use that awareness to guide your
      behaviour. In general, if you have a high EQ, you may find it easier to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>identify emotions in yourself and others</li>
      <li>empathize with other people</li>
      <li>adapt your feelings and behaviour to different situations</li>
      <li>control your impulses</li>
      <li>withstand temptations and delay gratification</li>
      <li>resolve conflicts with others</li>
      <li>communicate effectively</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="question">How is EQ different to IQ?</p>

    <p>
      While EQ refers to the ability to notice emotions in yourself and in
      others, and use this awareness to guide your actions/choices; IQ usually
      refers to intellectual ability, like problem solving, planning,
      understanding abstract ideas, learn and adapt to change, and grasp and use
      of language.
    </p>

    <p class="question">Why is EQ important?</p>
    <p>
      “Emotional intelligence has been linked to job success and more satisfying
      relationships. There’s also evidence that emotional intelligence may help
      you handle stress. A 2019 research review concluded that emotional
      intelligence can help you recover more quickly from acute stress.”
      (Stanborough, 2021)
    </p>
    <p>
      Success at work, better relationships and better stress management are
      wonderful reasons why Emotional Intelligence is important.
