    <h1>Margin, Border and Padding</h1>

    <h2>
      What is the difference between <b>Margin</b>, <b>Border</b>, and
      <b>Padding</b>?
    </h2>

    <p>
      That is a wonderful question if you, like me, are new to CSS and website
      designs. Margin and padding are very similar, but they are not quite the
      same, and there important difference in how to use them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In CSS, every element in the HTML file is put is a container (like a
      little box for each element). The limit of this container, as you probably
      already guessed, is the border. A margin is the space around an element’s
      border, while padding is the space between an element’s border and the
      element’s content. So, the margin property controls the space outside an
      element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.
      Check the image bellow.
    </p>
    <h3>Margin</h3>
    <p>This image represents the margin around the element.</p>

      Each element will have a margin that will keep each element on the page
      away from each other. We can control how far away or close to each of them
      will be, by adjusting their margin in the CSS file.

    <h3>Padding</h3>
    <p>
      You remember that each element in HTML is put in a kind of container, like
      a piece of cake on a plate. The margin is the space around the plate. The
      border is the edge of the plate. and the oadding is the space between the
      border of the plate and the content (piece of cake). The padding is
      represented in the image below:
    </p>
    <div class="intro">
      <figure>
        <img
        src=https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Update%20css%20margin%20vs%20padding-4.png?width=400&name=Update%20css%20margin%20vs%20padding-4.png"

    <h3>Uses for margins and paddings</h3>
    <p>
      We saw that the margins determine how much space there will be in each
      side of an element. So we can change the value in each side (top, right,
      bottom, left) to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Change an element's position on the page;</li>
      <li>Set the distance between nearby elements;</li>
      <li>Overlap elements.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      And since the paddings determine the space inside the element, we can also
      change those values in each side (top, right, bottom, left) to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add space between the content and its border; and</li>
      <li>Change the size of an element.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>Border</b> is the line between the margin and the padding. Every
      element in a page will always have margin and padding, even if there isn't
      a visible border. By default, the width of each border is set to 0 (zero),
      but we can change that with the CSS border property.
    </p>
    <h3>How to add margins and padding in CSS</h3>
    <p>
      To change the <b>margins</b> of an HTML element we can use the
      <b>margin</b> property to set the same value in all sides of the element
      selected. The value can be represented as a fixed length (most commonly
      px), a percentage (which defines the value as a percentage of the width of
      it's container) or auto (which lets the browser set the margin). For
      example, if we want to give all sides of an element a 20px margin, this is
      what it would look like:
    </p>
    <div>
      <figure>
        <img src="Img/margin20.jpg" />
      </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="child" id="example">(margin: 20px)</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      We can also select specific sides of an element and give them different
      values, using the margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom and margin-left
      properties. We can use them individually or use the margin property
      setting the values for each side, starting from the top and following
      clock-wise (top, right, bottom, left). Like this:
    </p>
    <div>
      <figure>
        <img src="Img/margins.jpg" />
      </figure>
    </div>
    <p>or like this:</p>
    <div>
      <figure>
        <img src="Img/margins2.jpg" />
      </figure>
    </div>
    <p>The blue area represents the margin.</p>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="child" id="example2">(margins: 10, 20, 40, 80)</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      To set the <b>paddings</b> of an element is very much like the margin
      property. The padding property also has four sides that we can select like
      we showed before with the margins, using the padding-top, padding-right,
      padding-bottom, padding-left properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the same element we used to represent the margins before, would look
      like this with a padding of 20px. Observe that the padding in the red area
      around the text.
    </p>
    <div>
      <figure>
        <img src="Img/padding1.jpg" />
      </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="child" id="example3">(padding: 20px)</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      And as we did with the margin property, we can assign different padding
      values to each side of the element we selected, by following the same
      convention. See bellow:
    </p>

    <div>
      <figure>
        <img src="Img/padding2.jpg" />
      </figure>
    </div>
    <p>It can also be expressed like this:</p>
    <div>
      <figure>
        <img src="Img/padding3.jpg" />
      </figure>
    </div>
    <p>And both will be read the same way by the browser, showing this:</p>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="child" id="example4">(paddings:10, 20, 40, 80)</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Again, the values used to determine the paddings, can also be represented
      as a fixed length or a percentage.
    </p>
