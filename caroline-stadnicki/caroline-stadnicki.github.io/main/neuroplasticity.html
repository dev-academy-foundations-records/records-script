<p class=" question">How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</p>
<p>
        Not too long ago, it was believed that a person’s brain was born with all the neuron connections in place with little space for change. 
    It is wonderful to see this concept evolve, providing us with a better understanding of how the brain works and what it’s capable of.
</p>
<p>
        Michael Rugnetta, wrote for <a href=”https://www.britannica.com/science/neuroplasticity” > Britannica.com</a>, explaining that 
    <b>neuroplasticity</b> is the “capacity of neurons and neural networks in the brain to change their connections and behaviour
    in response to <b>new information</b>, <b>sensory stimulation</b>, <b>development</b>, <b>damage</b>, or <b>dysfunction</b>. 
    Although some neural functions appear to be hard-wired in specific, localized regions of the brain, certain neural networks exhibit
    modularity and carry out specific functions while also retaining the capacity to deviate from their usual functions and to reorganize 
    themselves. Hence, neuroplasticity is considered generally to be a complex, multifaceted, fundamental property of the brain. “
</p>
<p>
        By learning how study, effort and repetition can create and strengthen new synapses, we now have a recipe for successfully developing new skills. 
    Now we know that it is not a matter of having or not a ‘gift’ for a certain thing, but rather a matter of how much effort we put into 
    learning something, and how many times we repeat it until we are confident in what we’ve learned. 
</p>
<p>
        Understanding and teaching about neuroplasticity can break stigmas and create a powerful community of life-long learners that know they 
    can learn anything they want, they can develop any skills they want, despite of where they came from, what their history is or their 
    socio-economic status.

<p class="question">
    How can you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.
</p>
<p>
   After learning that our brains are prepared to learn anything we put effort into learning,
   we just need to persist if something feels that is too hard. We can get there! The most important 
   thing to remember, is to never give up. The more we repeat, review, study and practice, the better we get in doing that.
   And it is not different here at Dev Academy. As long as I don't give up, and keep studying and practicing what I learn, I'll 
   become the Web Developer I'm aiming to become.
</p>
<p class="question">
    How can you increase your neuroplasticity?
</p>
<p>
    As you might have understood already, neuroplasticity is all about the brain creating and strengthening new pathways between the neurons,
    allowing us to learn new things and develop new habits. For that to occur we need challenges. We need something to push us out of our comfort zone.
    So if you want to increase your neuroplasticity, start embracing difficulty and welcoming challenge as a new best friend.
</p>
<p>
    Another important thing to do is to make sure your brain is as healthy as it can be, so it can properly do all that hard work of building new connections between you neurons.
    Along with eating healthy food, having proper sleep and exercising your body, studies show that connecting with others and practicing
     mindfulness also play an important part in promoting new brain connections and strengthening them.

<p class="question">
    Growth Mindset
</p>

<p>
    "Over 30 years ago, Carol Dweck and her colleagues became interested in students' attitudes about failure.
     They noticed that some students rebounded while other students seemed devastated by even the smallest setbacks. 
     After studying the behavior of thousands of children, Dr. Dweck coined the terms fixed mindset and growth mindset to describe the underlying beliefs people have about learning and intelligence.
     When students believe they can get smarter, they understand that effort makes them stronger. Therefore they put in extra time and effort, and that leads to higher achievement."

<div class="intro" alt="growth mindset grafic">
    <img src="Img/the-growth-mindset-i-can-get-smarter.png">
  </div>
<p>
   Dr Dweck also taught about "The Power of Yet", while explaining how adopting the mindset of "not yet" while facing falure,
   instead of seeing it as a tragedy, can drastically change the outcome of that learning experience. Those who don't give up 
   and understand that a 'failure' is an opportunity to try again, who persist in the task until they get it right, they reach better 
   results then those who get overwhelmed by the innitial setback and feel that it represents who they are, leading them to doubt of their 
   abilities and eventually give up on trying to complete the task. 
</p>
<p>
    Studies show that teaching about growth mindset can change the student's perpective towards challenges, aloowing the students to 
    learn from them, increasing their abilities and achivements.
    So, thanks to the ability our brains have to adapt and change connections, as we've seen in neuroplasticity, we can also learn, and teach,
     how to change from a fixed to a growth mindset.
</p>
<p>
    Next time you feel you failed to understand something, try to think "I haven't understood yet, but I'll keep trying until I do", and studies show that 
    you more likely to achieve your goal then those who have a fixed mindset. 
</p>

<p class="question"> What to do now with my Learning Plan?</p> 
<p>
    In my Learning Plan I explored some of my strengths and limitations, and they could impact my learning.
    With a better understanding of how my brain works and it's capability to learn new things, I can feel more 
    confident to achieve my goals, knowing that I can overcome any limitations, as long as I put in the effort to change what needs 
    to be changed. 
</p>
<p>
    It's also reassuring to know that even things that at some point might feel impossible to understand, can be learned if 
    I give it enough time and persevere in the process of learning.
