# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?
Really confident that I can make web pages with html and css, but not overly sure that I'm styling in the most efficient way. I will look at refactoring it all over the next few weeks.

Dev tools crash course was a bit overwhelming as I didn't really follow some of what was going on. 


### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?
I feel like I have a good grasp on the way a web page needs to be laid out now and how to go about finding the information for syntax etc. 


### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?
Dev tools and some of the concepts they were referring to were a bit foreign to me and I wasn't sure how to start researching them. 


### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?
I was getting a bit frustrated that I keep forgetting to commit and push things more frequently. 


### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?
I don't like it when strangers talk to me at bars, please go away. But if you want to know I could show you, I'm just not good at explaining things without props as I forget the names of words and concepts easily!
