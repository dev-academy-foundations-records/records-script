# My Reflections - Sprint Two
Grab a coffee for this one, I'm wired.
# Your Blog 

### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?
I first went into the folder on my laptop where my blog files are kept. I added a new file in there called 'blog' and I added the te houtaewa template file in to that file. Once all was saved I sent those changes through to GitHub so they would be live on the web page. 

Next I went back to my laptop in to the folder where my blog files are kept again and made another new folder called 'styles'. In this folder I added a new file to hold all the style information. 

I then went back to the template file from the first step and changed a link in there to make sure it's looking at the styles in the file I just created in step 2. 

Finally I sent those new changes to GitHub again for it to reflect on the live web page. 


### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?

Yikes, I forgot to turn the timer off again! I'm starting to think I need to do a count down rather than a count up...



# Learn HTML and CSS 

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?
This one has been a fun ride! I got too excited and only did half of the codecamp courses and then attempted to make a website. Then remembered that there was the course to do, did it and then realised that if I had just done the course first everything would have made sense much quicker... 

Ive been hyper fixating on getting the blog as I image it and I'm struggling to pull myself away when it isn't functioning as I wanted. Im hoping this is a side effect of my med increase and that itll pass in a few more days as I don't think this will be healthy long term! 

### What are of you proud of from this challenge?
I'm super happy with the responsiveness of my webpages... Please hit like and subscribe!

Also like that I've finally managed to decide on a layout that Im happy with. 


# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?
I thrive on context. The why is so important as I need to know all the detail so that it forms a string of comprehension in my brain and thats the only way I remember anything. I found the video hard to watch and follow along with because I didn't know why I was doing it which made it feel a bit overwhelming. 

### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?
Plenty! I'm still a bit unsure about dev tools but I'll look into this over the weekend. 

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
I have 12 tabs and all are study related but 80% of them are distractions! e.g. I started looking into something because it looked cool and I wanted to have a go, but I should have been looking at dev tools...

### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.
I wrote a 'review' of my one of my old jobs on their "quotes from customers" web page and sent a screenshot to an ex colleague... I wont elaborate because I'm professional, but it was 20% repressed feelings, 15% raw pain and 100% pure wit. 

# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  
Hillary Taylor Miller-Lane and Charlie Shelby-Smith have been together for enough time that no one really remembers what they were like before they met each other. I guess you could call them co-dependent. Although in modern psychology this isn't considered particularly healthy, their friends admire their relationship and comment on how well they work together as a team and complement each others strengths... but god forbid should something happen to either one of them. 

Hillary is a very practical person and enjoys making things from scratch. They will often find themselves tinkering away making boxes, containers and generally building cool functional new things. It always amazed Charlie how Hillary was able to build them a house from the ground up with only their bare hands. The house was able to withstand the elements, host many friends, and keep them and the contents of their home safe.

Charlie is a creative soul, and loves making things look *just right*. They can spend hours looking into colour theory and ways to display different elements in their home to complement and highlight certain things. They often will rearrange the furniture just to play around with the space and decide what looks best where. Their favourite thing to do is to customise each element in their home to appear different when different people would interact with it. Hillary has always thought this to be quite magical and loves that Charlie can use their mind to evoke different feelings and emotions using the framework of the foundations they built. 

Before Charlie came along Hillary functioned well and was able to get by just fine, but in 1994 everything changed. They met through mutual friends, Tim and Hakon at CERN, and hit it off immediately. Together they brought each other up and built themselves a house that not only functions, thanks to Hillary, but also looks incredible, with lots of personal quirks thanks to Charlie. 

After seeing how amazing they were at building homes together they began building many homes together. Within 20 years they're in more countries than McDonalds. This is one of their most visited and admired homes... https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/home.

### Any moments of surprise or joy? 
When I was asked to write a story I was joyously enthused. But I was also pretty stoked when I figured out what I was doing wrong with the flex wrap stuff. 

### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?
HTML would be a termite colony. The way they build their mounds from mud, spit and poop to make a functional, safe, yet visually unappealing structure makes me think of a raw HTML web page with minimal design elements. 

CSS reminds me of a Bower bird. The male of the species creates beautiful ornate displays using sticks, leaves, and brightly coloured objects to attract a mate. Quite the show off, completely unnecessary, but definitely well received.
