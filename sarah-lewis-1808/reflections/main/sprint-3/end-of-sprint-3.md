# Final Reflections - Sprint Three 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
I'm pretty solidly confident that I know what each of the things we learned does, and how its useful. My concern is tieing it all together. 


### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?
I struggled for a while during the dots game challenge as I think I was over thinking it. But when I button bashed and tried a few things for a while and when it finally worked I was SO happy. 


### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?
I don't think I've been angry, but I was a bit upset that I couldn't grasp the DOM stuff sooner because I didn't feel like I had any context. 


### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?
There have been a few times that I stopped and walked away before I got sucked in, but it was really great doing that as I was able to figure it out after taking a step back.
