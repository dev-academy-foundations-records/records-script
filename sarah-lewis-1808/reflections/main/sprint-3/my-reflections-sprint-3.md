# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness 

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?
No biases as such. I've read a lot about it before now and always try it now and again as it looks very well scientifically backed, but as I'm so inconsistent with keeping things up, I've never managed to get anything out of it before now. 


### How did you find the overall experience? 
I've made sure to keep up the mindfulness every morning and its been really great so far, so I'm hoping this is something I can develop into a morning routine. Also a great shout doing it after breakfast, as I'm a bit less hangry at that point and can concentrate a bit better!


### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness? 
Oh, see above! 




# Listening and Looping 

### What was it like to be fully listened to? 
It was quite unusual to be listened to by a white man for 2 full minutes, and then to have him reiterate what I said! GOSH! 


### What was it like to fully listen?
I think I'm pretty good at listening, as Im a stickler for detail, but when being asked to cover off what they said after listening, using my words, that was hard! As soon as it goes into my head the words are lost so when I repeat things back I will be able to use a key word or two, but unless I have time to think and write it out I can imagine it feels like I haven't listened but I definitely did! 
    




# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?
God, this was a rude awakening! I've needed to dissect the code line by line to understand whats going on so I've made MANY diagrams of the way to create functions, loops, conditionals, dom stuff. As I was doing it I was thinking it was wasting time and felt a bit bad about it, but I think its definitely helped me retain the logic of it all so it can't be all that bad. 


### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?
Nah it was a really wild ride this week. If I don't fully understand something I may as well not have even looked at it, so I think what looks like mastering the basics for me is just a case of having an all or nothing mindset. 

Saying that I've managed to finish everything by Friday evening and I'm feeling pretty confident that I've retained most of it.




# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?
Yes this was SO helpful, I was wondering whether the relevance of the DOM stuff was ever going to click, but having that video was super helpful. I think what confused me the most with the DOM intro was that we were using the dev tools for some of it and I wasn't understanding that we would later be using an actual js file to do it for real. 


### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?
That I can figure stuff out when I can concentrate, which is all very new to me. I was able to sit down and do math to figure out why something wasn't working correctly! My confidence in my ability to learn has already increased 10 fold. Knowing that this course would be really challenging for me, and having that kick me into gear to see a psychiatrist has truly been life changing. So I'm so grateful to be here, thank you to whoever signed that off!
