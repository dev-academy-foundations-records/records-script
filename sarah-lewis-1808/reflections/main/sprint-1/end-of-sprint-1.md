# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?
The study planning has been awesome so really appreciate that suggestion. I've found it a bit hard to do the time boxing as specified on each page, I forget to stop the timer! But I'm definitely breaking up the study to record whether I'm doing core or tech. 


### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
I feel pretty confident that I can do what I've learned this week and can repeat it all with full understanding. 


### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?
I really enjoy the command line as its so efficient and I'm all about efficiencies. I also really enjoy trying to shape new processes in my brain into image form as thats the best way for me to know that I've understood something. 


### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
I haven't found any of it tedious so far.


### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
Nah not really. I got a bit frustrated with myself when I got too excited and used the wrong command in the ko wai koe challenge and pushed to main instead of my branch, but I fully understand what I did wrong so I'm confident that I'll be able to avoid that in future.
