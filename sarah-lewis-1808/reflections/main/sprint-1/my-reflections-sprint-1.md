# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
The command line is a tool for users to access, edit and create files on a computer without using the visual user interface tools like Explorer or Finder. By typing specific commands into the terminal command line you are able to execute various tasks much more efficiently.

**Analogy :** The terminal command line is similar to voice command tools a visually impaired person would use instead of having access to the UI visual friendliness of the finder / explorer tool to navigate around the files and folders of the computer - instead of voice commands you use typed commands.

### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
Yes


### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1. **mkdir** followed by a new file name creates a file - must include the file type extenstion.
2. **echo** "add text" >> file-name.txt adds text to a specific file
3. **open** followed by a file name will open the file in its default application
4. **cp** file-name.txt file-name2.txt will copy the first file and create a duplicate with the following name - its also possible to keep the same name if specifying a location for the new copy by naming the location after
5. **rm -r** file-name.txt will delete the file


### Did you learn anything unexpected?
Nothing unexpected, but I got a little confused when I attempted to cp a file to the same folder without specifying a name for the copy as I assumed it would copy with the same name but thats obviously not possible!

Upon reflecting on my reflections I've learned that there are aliases to use instead of the long hand commands which are amazing!

# Version Control with Git 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?
*Git* is a tool to control the versions of source code that you have to ensure that all versions are stored and able to be referenced or referred to at a later stage. It also allows you to collaborate on source code without overwriting other peoples changes or edits. 

*GitHub* is a an online service that allows developers to store their source code and allows Git to send through changes or updates and makes version control more user friendly.



### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
GitHub is like a photo album where you store pictures of yourself from throughout your life - each time you take a photo you look slightly different. The difference being that if you wanted to then restore yourself to a previous version you could do that by taking that photo and adding it to the front of the album and you'd magically be 5 years old again! In this instance Git would be the every day tools you use to change your outward appearance and take photos of yourself.



### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
Yes definitely, especially if I use it every day


### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
Kind of. I'm struggling to remember to turn the timer off between tasks but I'm pretty sure I'm not going over time! 


# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a Git workflow?
A git workflow is a suggested methodology that specifies an order in which to work and run commands to keep consistency and efficiency between collaborators. 

I created a workflow diagram detailing the steps I took in this sprint to complete some of the tasks and challenges.

### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
I learn best when Im having a go at doing something myself so having the instructions step by step was super helpful and then being able to see them execute in front of me was very valuable. 

When Im confused or blocked I tend to google what Im stuck on and try a suggestion that seems right. Before realising that we would be doing it this way anyway I was recording all my reflections in a txt file from the command line using echo command and pushing to my test git repo. Long way of doing it, but I learned some stuff! I got a bit stuck when I tried to move the files to a different folder on my laptop and made the mistake of renaming everything. Didn't think of the repercussions of that for pushing that remotely so I got in a bit of a mess. Started again cloning the GitHub repo though and re init-ed in my new folder so all is well now. 



### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
I'd maybe go a bit slower so that I don't make silly mistakes from getting too excited!


# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?

Staging is like a photo booth where you wait to have a photo taken. You can add more people in to the booth, change your outfit a few times and get back in. Committing is when you take the photo. The commit stores the people and their appearance at that particular point in time.


# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?
Main is the original copy of the file that is the source of truth.


### Why create a Branch?
A branch allows you to take a copy of the main branch at a point in time and allows you to merge your changes to this branch over time, rather than sending straight to the main branch. This is useful if you have a big project to work on that you need to spend some time on and make lots of amendments to.



### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?  
Yes it all seems quite sensible and familiar. My previous job dealt a lot with bug fixes and escalating issues to developers so Im familiar with the concepts of branches and staging etc. and branching is the default way my brain works anyway! I made a diagram of a branch analogy that I've added to this repo.




# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?
If you would like to use some open source code as a starting base for your own project - it will copy the whole repo along with all the version history. Then when you push changes through to GitHub it will push to your forked repo rather than the original owners. 



### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?
I don't think it all clicked at a particular moment but when I work on trying the concepts myself it clicks in to place gradually.


# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?
This was a pretty straight forward activity. The steps were explained in a logical process that made it easy to understand so I'm confident that I'm cementing the learning well. I didn't feel frustrated at all during this exercise.


### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?
Having completed some Codecademy courses in the past I was aware this was how websites were made so it wasn't too unfamiliar but it's great to see the process from the ground up! I really thrive when I understand something from the beginning to end, I like the detail and knowing the hows and whys of the process helps me understand. 




# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?
The process I've adopted for solving problems stems from my prior role in customer support for a fin-tech start up. Generally I'll try to determine how something should work and I'll talk it out loud and/or click through the steps or type out what I'm doing. If I'm not sure how it's supposed to work I'll normally research the topic and logically determine what I think should happen. Once I've figured that out I'll look at what is actually happening and try to find the step that the process is failing on. Then I'll talk that through again and see if my assumptions are correct. Once I've got a good idea about the issue I'll see if I can figure out what needs to change to make it work correctly. Google is generally the first port of call and I'll try some suggestions online but once I've exhausted those options or I don't find any I'll reach out to someone with a little more experience. The beauty of over thinking and over analysing *everything* is that I will often imagine every possible response I might get from someone before I've even asked and that will generally lead me in the right direction!   




# Introduce yourself

Kia ora, I'm Sarah. I'm currently fortunate enough to be living with family in Waiake on the North Shore of TƒÅmaki Makaurau but I'm originally from Cymru Wales. 

I spent my 20s wandering around the world looking for the next new stimulating experience with no aim or desires, then fortunately landed in Aotearoa in 2018 and fell for all of it. Since being here I've thought about and experienced the importance of community and belonging and feeling connected to those around you. As someone who spent 33 years as an undiagnosed neurodivergent I've often felt on the outside, so knowing that I'm not alone has been ground breaking. 

Now with the tools in place to help me succeed with my brain instead of against it, I'm finally able to challenge my potential. Dev Academy is the first step in proving my biases wrong and I'm hoping that I can gain skills to help contribute to my community in a meaningful way and assist others who may be feeling disconnected.

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 

I find it difficult to summarise most things to be honest! I was told that I tend to give too much context to stories, so considering I was trying to summarise something I know a lot about was hard! 

### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 
I always feel a little nervous about how I present to new people as I've also been told that I can be quite blunt which may seem a little rude. That is definitely not my intention though so I always try to be aware of my ego and analyse my words to make sure I'm not including information thats unimportant and self serving, and also that I'm not including words that may be unconsidered.
