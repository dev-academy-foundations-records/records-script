# My Reflections - Sprint Five 


# Tic-Tac-Toe

### What was the most challenging part of this exercise for you?
The readme docs were a little hard to follow. I get a bit lost when I have to follow lots of wordy instructions. The main issue I had though was knowing how to end the game. I struggled with that one for a while but Gerard helped a lot in one of the Q&A sessions so managed to fix that up pretty quickly after that.


### What learning(s) are you going to takeaway from this exercise?
I now know that the else at the end of an if statement isn't compulsory... that was good to know. Couldn't find that documented anywhere. Also learned that return can be used if there is no else to specify. 


# Pair Programming

### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?
I do enjoy having a real life rubber duck. My prior roles have had a lot of pair work, as the products have been pretty complicated so knowing eveyrthing wasn't really an option. I think this is pretty standard in the tech world though so its good to be able to pair code. 



### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during Bootcamp? Why so?
I will struggle explaining stuff I think, so I hope its not too big a barrier. As I don't really retain the words to describe things either that might be an issue. For example I can see what the formats of each of the loops look like but I can't remember what any of them are called. 



# Inflate the Unicorn

### Did you learn anything new during this exercise? What was it?
I learned that I shouldn't be left alone for too long or I start losing it. Jared was super helpful explaining this one to me so I'm really grateful that he was able to jump on a zoom. This one got me to cement the square bracket notation concept though, and spending so much time fiddling around with the code has made my typing improve heaps!



### Did you encounter issues completing any of the steps of this exercise? How did you resolve this?
Right, yes, see above. I had issues formulating a way of storing what each unicorn status was so I spent WAY too long trying everything that wasn't right until Jared jumped on a zoom with me and I was then able to fix it in 5 minutes. Lesson here is that being on my own isn't always a good idea when I'm learning as I would never have come up with the solution on my own. 



### If you were to replace the unicorn with another mystical animal of your choice, what would it be?
People tell me that whalesharks are real, and when I was a diving instructor it was the ultimate on the list of things to see. I'm yet to believe they even exist, as I think that the 3 times I was underwater with students and EVERYONE else on the boat saw them but me was just a huge gaslighting exercise. 



# Whack-a-mole

### What was the hardest part of this exercise?
I loved this one. After I had the unicorn thing explained I was able to get this one done pretty easily. I didn't get around to doing the stretch stuff other than adding a count, but I'm hoping to work on something similar next week. 



### Can you think of any different ways you could have accomplished the same outcome?
No not yet but I'm going to look into it next week. 



# Dress the Clown

### How did you find the process of refactoring your code?
I enjoyed refactoring as it was good to be able to get a more concise method of doing things. 



### Would you do anything differently if you were to start this challenge again?
I'd definitely ask for help sooner as I think I could have played around a bit more with other things. 



### What piece of code are you proudest of from this exercise?
I was pretty chuffed with all of it to be honest. I feel like this one challenged me in the right ways and I took away a lot more from this one. Although I did get stuck on this one too, I feel like I did the majority of the hard bit myself which I'm pleased with.



# JS Carnival

### What parts of these challenges did you enjoy? If we were to add more challenges, what would you like to have more of?
I loved all of these, they were really engaging and it was satisfying to have the visual components. I'd have liked to have spent more time doing these over the last few weeks as I learned more from this than any of the other exercises. But then again that may be because the other exercises set me up well for it... 



### What parts weren't so good? Were there any parts that you felt stuck on?
Yea I don't know how people would have just been able to know exactly what to do for some of it. Once I've been shown something once I will remember it forever but knowing that I would have needed a particular array in a particular place instead of what I was doing didn't feel like it was something I'd have been able to work out on my own. 



### Which parts made you feel confident?
I felt confident when I was able to do the murder mole one on my own without help. But I did watch Joseph do a similar one the day before so I'm not sure if that counts. That said, I watched a few people do a few of the things and I wasnt able to do them without help. 



### What personally would you want changed to improve the carnival?
I think a few more of those types of exercises the week before would have been good.

# Stretch

Didnt get around to the stretch stuff but I'll look at it next week.
