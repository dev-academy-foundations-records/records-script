# Final Reflections - Sprint Five 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:


### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?
Very satisfying when I was able to complete the exercises and to see it all work. 


### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?
When I got stuck on stuff and didn't feel like the answer was something I would have been able to get to on my own. 


### Was Foundations what you expected it to be like? If not, what was different?
It was a lot quicker than I expected but I think thats because I was enjoying it so much. 



### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?
None. I would like to do a few more weeks before bootcamp!



### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?
Im worried that I haven't learned enough.



### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?
If you're there, good job completing it! That's a pretty big deal, don't brush this off you should be proud. 



### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?
Nah not really, I feel like a person that can do a bit of programming. Don't really like labels, they're very black and white.
