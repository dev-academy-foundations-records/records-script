# My Reflections - Sprint Four 

# Code Readability

### What makes code more readable for you?
As I find reading words quite a challenge I find code a bit more engaging as it has the colour patterns to distinguish between the different syntax. That said, I definitely notice the difference between code that isn't indented correctly, it's super hard to follow when it's not got a concise layout. 


### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?
I prefer tabs as it shows a more clear separation in my brain, whereas the spacing isn't a big enough distance to indicate the differentiation I think. 


### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?
My workspace must be spotless before I begin or I get distracted seeing things that need to be done. I definitely think I need to find my groove with the tidiness of the code as I'm currently more concerned about getting it to work, but I am all for tidy everything so it's high on my list of priorities!



# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    let expected = 7
    let actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```
### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`: 
```
sum(3, 4)
```

### Do you think you would prefer using Test Driven Development? Why?
This is a great idea and I am all for it as I've been on the customer facing end of many a gnarly bug that was a pain to test on the dev side, one in particular ended up being a 10 month wait for a fix that could have been solved if the code was written in a way that meant it could be tested without the need for real data and a developer with decades of experience to decipher! I do understand though that it may not happen everywhere, especially in start ups where theres a lot of pressure for a MVP in a short space of time. That said, I'm willing to change my mind on that excuse if I find with experience that it's just laziness and poor planning!

Sarah in the future here. I talked to my dad who started his web development career in 1998. He scoffed at the idea of test driven development, so I think that must mean its a pretty good idea... 

# Kata

### How did you find using repl.it in practice? Confusing? Useful?


### Was it helpful to look at the tests while coding the kata?
Yes I found it was useful to see what the issue was. Although I spent a lot of time on one issue that ended up being because I had accidentally deleted something from the export section at the bottom... 

### What problem solving techniques did you implement in your coding flow?
I used Google a lot to find the suggested options to solve the issue and then I chose the ones that looked like I would understand what they were doing.

### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?
I spent way too much time trying to make an array that generated random numbers for me to use when I was testing my solution to the actual exercise. I really enjoyed the Super FizzBuzz, I didn't have many issues with this one and it was so satisfying when it worked!

### Did you want to change and refactor your code once you were finished?
No, definitely not. I was too scared to change anything incase it broke!
