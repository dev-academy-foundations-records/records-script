# My Reflections - Sprint Five

# Tic-Tac-Toe

### What was the most challenging part of this exercise for you?

Knowing where to start..... I can safely say, without the Readme file. I would be completely lost. It feels like I have learnt a lot but I just don't know how to apply it yet.

### What learning(s) are you going to takeaway from this exercise?

Honestly, just to keep at it. I am hoping the more I code the more familiar I get, cos my brain works by seeing a pattern in things and how the corelate. If I don't see the pattern or corelation, it just won't click.

# Pair Programming

### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?

No, I do not have prior experience with pair coding and I am a little be hesitant about doing so.

### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during Bootcamp? Why so?

Yes I do feel it would be a challenge for me personally. I like working alone most of the time, and I am quite an introvert so I tend to avoid interacting with others whom I don't know very well. I do however feel comfortable working with people I trust, so pair programming with people I have build that trust with is very easy for me.

But going into Bootcamp, I will give this a crack and see how I go.

# Inflate the Unicorn

### Did you learn anything new during this exercise? What was it?

I think this is quite challenging. I really just watched Gerard coding on "Crack-the-egg" and applied that on to the Unicorn. This challenge was really tough and I don't think there is any way I can complete this in 3 hours because I have easily spent more than 6 hours on this....

### Did you encounter issues completing any of the steps of this exercise? How did you resolve this?

YEP, I didn't even know where to start. Just ended up watching Gerard's video to figure each step.

### If you were to replace the unicorn with another mystical animal of your choice, what would it be?

Hahahha I think my brain is not really focused on this, but more on the fact that I'm struggling. Maybe I will answer this one day when I'm more comfortable with coding.

# Whack-a-mole

### What was the hardest part of this exercise?

Actually coded this along while watching Joseph's video so I didn't struggle much as Joseph explained it step by step.

### Can you think of any different ways you could have accomplished the same outcome?

Because I'm still quite new to coding..... so no. Not at this stage.
