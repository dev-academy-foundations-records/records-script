# Final Reflections - Sprint Five

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?

The initial 2 weeks where it was HTML and CSS hahhaha. Also knowing that I'm not struggling alone.

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?

Well I don't use the word bad, but it is VERY CHALLENGING learning JavaScript

### Was Foundations what you expected it to be like? If not, what was different?

I can't really say this is what I expected it to be, because I didn't actually know what to expect of it.... But it is definitely very challenging for someone with no prior programming exp.

### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?

Like from week 2 after seeing other people's blogs on discord.... "Failure is NOT an option" is what kept me going, that an also the thought of continuing aimlessly at what I was doing before Dev.

### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?

DEFINITELY under prepared. I fully intend to spend the week of break before bootcamp, just going over all the JS materials that were covered, and going back to basics by doing some materials in Freecodecamp. I am in semi panic mode.

### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?

The only thing I can see myself saying is, "Remember to take your breaks, if you ain't getting it, more brute forcing is not going to help anyway."

### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?

NO hahhah I may think like a programmer (like wanting to find the shortest most effective way to solve a problem), but when it comes to writing codes.... I don't know where to start. Maybe this is still early stages, so we shall see.
