# Final Reflections - Sprint Two

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?

Got a bit stuck with HTML and CSS when we had to do it on our own blog. Understanding it in theory is one thing. Putting it in to practice is the time consuming part. I do get the feeling of TOO MUCH I don't understand and I have very little time to learn.

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?

Towards the end of the sprint where I can see my blog coming to life and it looks a bit more presentable.

### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?

Everything during and after the "Add HTML and CSS to your blog" part

### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?

Seeing other people's blogs definitely made me feel small about my own blog. But at the same time this also helps me see where I can make improvements on my own blog.

So I guess its not entirely just critical, I can see the benefits as well when looking at others and seeing where I can improve on my own area.

### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?

I would say I can help them with that. But I would also say that I can only do the basics of setting up informative sites that links to other sites, if they wanted it to look appealing and have fanciful add ons, then they are better off looking into getting a Web Designer to do that for them.
