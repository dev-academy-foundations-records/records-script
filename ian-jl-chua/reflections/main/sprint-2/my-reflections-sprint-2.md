# My Reflections - Sprint Two

# Your Blog

### Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?

1. Created 2 folders inside a Github repo
2. Created 2 files (one inside each folder) for instructions on how we want our website to look like
3. HTML file consist of instructions on what the HTML page would display, css file is currently empty so there are no styles to our website

### How are you finding working with the timeboxes?

Quite ok, I did play around with a bit of HTML and CSS on other websites so this was not as foreign to me as the previous tech part of Sprint 1.

# Learn HTML and CSS

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?

Didn't come up against much obstacles just yet. I did spend a bit of time playing with the other HTML and CSS courses on the Freecodecamp site. Also added a few extensions to VS code to help make the visual more readable and user friendly.

### What are you proud of from this challenge?

Being able to revisit some of the things I learned from playing with HTML and CSS on Freecodecamp. This bit of revision does help solidify some of the tags that are used on HTML files and also what can be used on CSS files. Also finding out about Media Queries is definitely an eye opener.

I am able to keep to this timebox as some of the material are a revision for me instead of learning it for the first time.

# DevTools Tutorial

### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course?

It is quite a lot to take in. Although there is a tendency to want to play around with the tools a bit more, I am conscious about the timebox in the module. Having a video learning environment also helps as I find myself replaying parts of the video over and over again, just to have a better understanding of one section. I did get a bit confused about the console part of the video, but I am assuming it is because I don't have any experience with JavaScript.

### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?

Not really blocks as per se, but a lot of new information to take in so this can be quite overwhelming.

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

About 5 tabs, if we are not counting VS Code, iTerm and Discord. Of the 5 tabs opened in Firefox, 1 is personal email, 1 is Facebook, the other 3 are study related tabs (DevAcademy Hanbook, Github, Google Chrome DevTool video)

### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.

I did play around with different websites, just to see how their website is laid out. Took a look at the similarities and differences in the HTML layout and what CSS are used for the different pages

# Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge

### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.

HTML is kind of like the main structure of a company and CSS is kind of like specific individual roles in that company.

With a small business, the Director might be the same person who is the boss, the staff and the accountant of the company. The sole person would be like HTML where they could perform all the functions of the company to run the business.

As the company grows, it would need specific people for specific roles, because the roles start to become more demanding and more detailed. So the Director might have to hire a manager, and various staff, and have an accountant. So all the people would be like CSS where they have specific roles to play in a business.

### Any moments of surprise or joy?

There is definitely surprise, but I won't really say it would be joy. Being surprised about how much I still don't understand.

Understanding the elements are one thing. But deciding where to use them, and how to use them, and when to use them is a completely different ball game.

I realized how hard it was to have no structure and to be given creative freedom (as long as the competency sections are covered).

It isn't a structure like, "you must have 3 'div' elements" or "you need to have at least 3 'p' elements". There is more flexibility in what can be used. I seem to struggle with a situation of "too many options" or "not enough options".

### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?

This quite hard to compare this with animals but HTML could be like the Flathead Sculpins and CSS could be like a Chameleon. HTML is similar to the Flathead Sculpins in a sense that it has all the basic structure that an animal requires and its very limited in what it can do, where CSS is similar to a Chameleon because it it can change its color to a similar style to its environment.
