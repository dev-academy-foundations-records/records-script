# Final Reflections - Sprint Four

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

If I'm being honest, I feel like I'm drowning and occasionally able to have my head above water. It feels like I'm learning a lot but some parts are just not connecting for me so I end up forgetting it again.

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?

I would say no parts, but I think I'm being a bit too self critical so I can't really tell....

### Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?

Almost every single part apart from the Core, which doesn't require a lot of brain power

### How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?

I did end up with periods where I didn't take enough breaks..... only because I want to power through, knowing I will fall behind if I don't power through.

I do take time for stretches but they are minimal. Definitely not sure about the rewards part

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say?

Please take a break where you can. Because you are already gonna blow out the timebox, so you might as well take a break hahhahah
