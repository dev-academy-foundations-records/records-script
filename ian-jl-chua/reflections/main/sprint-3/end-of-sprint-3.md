# Final Reflections - Sprint Three

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

Marginally confident, I feel that I need a lot more practice and a lot more work on them.

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?

The listening and looping part was the easier and manageable part. It feels nice when you see the other person smile because you could repeat everything they said, back to them.

### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?

Not so much angry, but it was really frustrating going through the JS-Intro part. Its due to a combination of not knowing how much I don't know, and also not getting enough time to learn it all, or at least learn to a point where I'm comfortable before moving on.

### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?

Like almost every single module from Sprint 3 Tech..... I didn't give up because I refuse to accept failure or defeat as an option. Also the fact that I know the more I practice, the more it would make sense.
