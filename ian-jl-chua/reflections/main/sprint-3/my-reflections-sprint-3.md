# My Reflections - Sprint Three

# Mindfulness

### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?

Growing up in a Buddhist environment, I found mindfulness and meditation to be incredibly helpful. I have also lived in a monastic environment (for about 3 months) where mindfulness and mediation is practiced on a daily basis. Going from this to working in retail, is a good way to lose hope in humanity.

During my stay at the Buddhist monastery, I noticed that I have more patience and understanding or at least a sense of empathy towards others. I am fairly sure that this had a lot to do with the mindfulness and mediation practice, because I'm sure that in any environment there will be people who say things or do things that annoys me, but I do feel more aware and responsive instead of reactive while I lived there.

### How did you find the overall experience?

Overall I feel mindfulness is useful in day to day life to cultivate a sense of wellbeing and this also helps me manage the difficult challenging situations in life

### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness?

I aim to at least meditate for 10(if not at least 5) minutes a day. I normally do this either in the morning when I first wake up or last thing I do before going to bed.

The getting up early to meditate is really when I have trouble sleeping the night before.

# Listening and Looping

### What was it like to be fully listened to?

It was nice. It feels like the interaction was genuine and not forced, and I had an opportunity to get my feelings and ideas across.

### What was it like to fully listen?

Active listening is something I am working on so it is a good opportunity for me to have practice on this. I also notice the tendency in me of wanting to cut in, to put my point across.

It was good to see first hand the benefits of active listening. Because the other person gets their voice heard and their point put across, and also as the lister I get to paint a clearer picture of what the other person is trying to say, instead of putting my views on what I think the other party means.

Having the looping also helps reaffirm the person who you are listening to, that you have heard their message, and that both of you are on the same page

# Intro to JavaScript

### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why?

I actually quite enjoy the part where we get to code along with Joseph. I found that this helps me understand the JS-intro part a bit better. Up until the point where we are coding along with Joseph, it just feels like I'm learning bits an pieces and none of them really made any sense, because I can't see how they fit together as a big picture.

### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to _master_ the basics?

Definitely not keeping within the timebox. It was a bit of both. It was definitely challenging understanding the basics, but also at the same time, looking at various different examples online only made it more confusing so, not quite sure how to tackle this.

# JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along

### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together?

Yes this was REALLY helpful, this helped me understand a little more on certain parts of the JS Intro that we were doing. Having Joseph explained each part and what he was doing and the reason behind doing that, was really helpful.

### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity?

I would say I realised how much of this I still don't really understand if I'm asked to explain. It seems like there are part of it where I somewhat understand, then when I see another example of it being done and I got confused, that's when I feel I haven't understood that to begin with.

I am hoping to keep looking at more examples and keep looking at different answers and eventually it would click for me.
