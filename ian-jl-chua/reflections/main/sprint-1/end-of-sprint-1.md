# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?

The one thing that really stood out for me, was noticing how I can get so lost in wanting to know more about a topic that I lose track of time. What can start off as watching a 15 min video on basic commands that are used on the terminal, can end up taking 2 hours because I watched other videos about the same topic (wanting to know more about commands). This has set me back quite a bit, but I somewhat made up for lost time because of the knowledge that was gained. But if everything is time bound, I can see this causing issue in the future so I am more conscious about the time box for each topic.

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

Somewhat confident, I would say about 65% confident about everything that I have learned in Sprint 1

### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?

It was the Core part of Sprint 1 that I really enjoyed. Yes it is challenging to dig deep and really look into certain topics like values and strength, but this is the part that doesn't really deal with memorizing or understanding new things. It is more reflecting on things that have already been experienced.

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

I won't say any part of it was tedious at all, but the Tech part of Sprint 1 was definitely challenging. I would consider myself quite tech-savvy (seeing as everyone from my family, friends, and work colleagues all come to me for tech related issues), and even so I still found the Tech aspect to be a bit of a challenge. Maybe being dyslexic just means it takes me a bit more time to click.

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

Oh yes, 100%. Seeing other people post up questions on Discord, makes me see how far back I am in the Sprint. Especially when people are asking about Ko Wai Koe and I'm still looking through the Command line section. Naturally the mind proceeds to panic and critique. Understanding oneself is also about understanding one's capabilities and shortfall, so while I know that I take a while to grasp certain topic, I also know that once I understand that topic, I end up knowing it inside out.
