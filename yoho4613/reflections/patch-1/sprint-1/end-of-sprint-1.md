# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?
I have learned how to pull, push to github from my local directory. 
I saw there was some delay sometimes on github.

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
I fully understand how github repository works


### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?
I like to have my own cloud space for my codes.


### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
It did not take long time for all there was no tedious.


### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
I thought it might be easy to learn entire course but the biggining is always easy. I will keep focus on entire course whether sprint is easy or hard.
