# Final Reflections - Sprint Three 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
I am confident to figuring out all the tasks in sprint so far. It did not take long time to get it done.
However, It was difficult and took long time to answering the question by words. I had to think a lot and deep to make the answer as text.


### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy?
All the coding practice in sprint was easy and make me feel happy. Everytime I figure out tasks it feel great!


### Which parts of this sprint made you angry?
None of coding practice made me feel angry but, some question I feel so angry because I could not make perfect text answer as I was thinking in my head.


### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you?
It did not make me want to give up at all. Honestly, I don't think any of sprint even for upcoming sprints will make me feel give up.
Because I am confident that If I am going to want to give up, I would not start it.
