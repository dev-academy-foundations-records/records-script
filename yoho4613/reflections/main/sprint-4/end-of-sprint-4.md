# Final Reflections - Sprint Four 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
I am very confident so far. 


### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?
All the test helps me to code better.


### Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?
Somtimes when there's typo issue and takes long time, I feel I am un-smart.


### How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?
Everytime I feel tire and feel like my brain is not working well, I have break.


### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say? 
Read the corriculum carefully. Do not miss any task!
