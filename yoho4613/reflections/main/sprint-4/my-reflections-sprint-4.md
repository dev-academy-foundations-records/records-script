# My Reflections - Sprint Four 

# Code Readability

### What makes code more readable for you?
1. Consistent indentation and spacing
2. Meaningful naming conventions for variables, functions and classes
3. Clear and descriptive comments
4. Modular and organized structure
S. imple and straightforward logic.


### Do you prefer tabs or spaces when indenting?
Tap definitely.


### What is your workspace like in real life? Clean? Messy? Is your code a reflection of that?
I am trying to remain them clean but mostly messy. Same on code, I am always trying to make them well organised but everytime I actually coding mostly messy.



# Testing

```
function testSum(){
    let expected = 7
    let actual = sum(5, 2)

    if (actual != expected) {
        console.log("It's broken..")
    } else {
        console.log("It works!")
    }
}
```
### Have a go at writing a "sum" function below that would make the above function print out `"It works!"`: 
```
function sum(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
    }
```

### Do you think you would prefer using Test Driven Development? Why?
Yes. It gives me clearly correct or wrong and it does not matter how I figured out.



# Kata

### How did you find using repl.it in practice? Confusing? Useful?
I have never used repl.it yet. I have visited website and it quite confusing but seems useful.

### Was it helpful to look at the tests while coding the kata?
It was very helpful. It is very good for brain training.

### What problem solving techniques did you implement in your coding flow?
I have search on google when I can't remember return value and parameter on method. 

### What was the most challenging part of Super FizzBuzz for you?
I needed to check case sensitive but it was easy to figure out.

### Did you want to change and refactor your code once you were finished?
Yes. Everytime I refector my codes, I can make the code much simpler and clear.
