# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?
Sometimes Github has delayed after I have commit on repo but I relized there is delay sometimes


### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
I am confident that I may slow learner but I will definetely learn at the end.


### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?
I like learning new skills!


### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
While I am figuring issue out, I feel tedious but when I figured out I feel so happy


### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
Yes I always think and tell my self you are so stupid because can not figure out small issues but everytime I found the reason and figure out all issues, I am so happy.
