# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
Command line was easy and quite stright foward words. I could logically understand the command lines.


### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
I actually did not follow the timebox guidelines but still trying to use timebox guidelines.


### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.

1. mkdir - make directory
2. touch - create file
3. rmdir - remove directory
4. code . - open the file on VSCODE
5. ls - see the list of existing files and folder in current directory


### Did you learn anything unexpected?
I have tried group repository and folk first time. I learned how group project is pushed to github repo.


# Version Control with Git 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What's the difference between git and GitHub?
git is software that helps developer to maintain their sourse files
github is cloud-based platform that save the source files by using git


### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
I think Git is the functional software program that I can use and Github is the cloud space where I save my files.


### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
Yes I can remember what I learned this week.


### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
No, It might because I am not get used to use the timebox system yet and It did not take long. But I will try to use it from next sprint.


# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is a Git workflow?
git clone                               git pull
           -  git add - git commit - 
git init                                git push


### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
I understood basic flow and logic but in detail when I actually type the codes always little more detail were nedded so I have read back from curriculum and search on google and read QAs on Stack Overflow.


### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
I would search more clearly so I can save more time


# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?
Stage is saving the updated files in local storage 
commit is saving the updated files in Github repository which is cloud storage


# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is main?

main means main branch in repository. When there are multiple different version of branch, in main, the final version or main version of sources will be saved.

### Why create a Branch?
When we develop large project, there will be many case we should save as different version of codes. In that case we can commit the different version as new branch so anytime project sources need to change we can easily update the source codes.


### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?  
It was not difficult to understand. We are already using cloud database and word, excel sheet by using 'save as' function. I think those are similar logic.


# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?
When we share same sheet to many people and receive back with different answers, fork will be helpful. For other case, when we need many exmaple of logic but for same result of codes folk will be helpful.



### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?
I don't understand where it all clicked.


# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?
Sometimes even I followed same codes and same command it shows different result with tutorial. In that case I feel trustated but I know with different computer set up and environment that can happened I just need to Google it.


### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?
Before I know coding skills, I thought web development is very professional skills with professional computer.




# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?
Read curriculum again and search on Google and read same question on Stack overflow.




# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 
I am very passionate and hard worker type of person. Even I meet many problems and issues while I study and working, I never give up and get up set but just try to figure out until it is.


### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 
Yes. But I always try not to bother other people.
