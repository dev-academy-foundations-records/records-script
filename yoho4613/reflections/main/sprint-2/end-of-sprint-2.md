# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?
So far, sprint 1 and 2 were very easy to get the task done. But still feel nervious for future tasks.


### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?
sprint 2 because I feel I really make something!


### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?
Nothing so far, I guess soon, next sprint will give me some.


### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?
It still says you can do it. And it helps me to be confident.


### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?
I do make website by the tool that name "VSCODE" it helps me to use HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT etc...
