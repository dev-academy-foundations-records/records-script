# My Reflections - Sprint Five 


# Tic-Tac-Toe

### What was the most challenging part of this exercise for you?
It was easy to make it work with 2 players but it was hard to make computer so 1 payer play with compuer.


### What learning(s) are you going to takeaway from this exercise?
I have learned how to make codes well organised. For example, by organise well codes, I can switch 1 player mode and 2 players mode.


# Pair Programming

### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?
I don't have pair coding experience yet. I wish I could have pair coding experience soon with bootcamp so I can share ideas with my team.



### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during Bootcamp? Why so?
Yes it will be very challengable for me because I have no experience. As I have been coding alone always, there will be some different style with other people but, it will be also very helpful.



# Inflate the Unicorn

### Did you learn anything new during this exercise? What was it?
Nothing was new but I have tried to make the code efficient so with same result much effective.



### Did you encounter issues completing any of the steps of this exercise? How did you resolve this?
When the last balloon was inflated, alert showed up but last img tag did not updated yet. So I have added setTimeOut function to give some spare time to replace the image before alert show up.



### If you were to replace the unicorn with another mystical animal of your choice, what would it be?
It would be a flying bird with wings and I will replace the image so bird seems flying!



# Whack-a-mole

### What was the hardest part of this exercise?
For me, it was hard to addEventListener and removeEventListener but after a while I relised I could just addEventListener to img tag so I do not have to removeEventListener.



### Can you think of any different ways you could have accomplished the same outcome?
There are many different ways that can make same result but with my idea, current way is the shortest codes and the most efficient way to code. 
There is no reason to make it differently if it is not effective. 



# Dress the Clown

### How did you find the process of refactoring your code?
Once I have done the project, I have read again the codes from top to bottom. In order to refactor my codes effectively, I have googled, how to refactor and follow the step.



### Would you do anything differently if you were to start this challenge again?
I may write the comment withe more details so I can save more time to solve same challenge.



### What piece of code are you proudest of from this exercise?
I have tried to make efficient way to check conditional statement by using if statement and switch. I am not sure that was best way to make it but I have considered at this part most of time. Also, In order to screenshot the page with button, I have googled and save a lot of time to solve it.



# JS Carnival

### What parts of these challenges did you enjoy? If we were to add more challenges, what would you like to have more of?
I have enjoied whack-a-mole part. Becuase it looks real game and I loved to make the game and I had more ideas to add in the game.
It would be fun if we add the 'Random Question Game' that has object that contains many questions and answers and randomly show than player guess the answer. Or, it could be "Guess Random Number Game" that random number will be chosen and player will guess within limited guesses.



### What parts weren't so good? Were there any parts that you felt stuck on?
I did not like Inflate-Unicorn. I did not felt stuck but that is the reason. It was easy but there was have to be some stuck logic in order to improve my skill.



### Which parts made you feel confident?
In dress-the-clone part, I needed to think many time with different ways to solve the conditional statement. After I have found the effective way and solve the problem, I felt confident.



### What personally would you want changed to improve the carnival?
Each challenge required different logic. I wish unicorn also should require some considerable logic.

# Stretch


## Calculator

### What was the most challenging part of this calculator exercise for you?
It was really challenging part when user did not use equal button but keep adding more numbers with operator. I should have keep calculating with keeping the calculated value so there should be 2 variables of number.


### What was a highlight?
The highlight part is that it can saves the accumliated value until user click the equal button.


### Which pairing role did you enjoy most? Why?
I loved to make the if statement part. It is always making me to think smarter. I always try to make the efficient way to make if statement.


# Minesweeper

### What was the hardest moment(s) of this challenge for you? How did you overcome them?
It was hard to making checkWin function. There were many condition to check and some of them were checking true and some of them were false, also, I needed to check it was mine or not before make above conditions. It seems messed so I have deleted all the lines and make the pesudo codes and started again. Then it works fine.


### What learnings are you going to take away from this challenge?
Sometimes, when my head is messed with all the logic, I need to add pesdo codes for make it clear then I will know where to start and what to do.
