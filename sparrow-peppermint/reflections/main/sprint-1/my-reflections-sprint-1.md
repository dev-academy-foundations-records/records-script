# My Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### **In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?** 
<br>  

The command line is a way to interact with your computer, similar to using the finder application or file directory. Using specific text commands, we can use the command line interface or to move through folders, open and edit files, interact with applications and software on your computer and more.

If your computer was a chef, the command line is like an endlessly editable recipe book, through which you can give your chef specific step-by-step instructions to cook up whatever you are craving. It is a communication tool.<br><br>  
  
### **Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?**
<br>

I didn’t pay close attention to how much time I spent on each part of this page. I am adjusting to the process of tracking my time and using the pomodoro timer, and in the future I will try setting specific timers for each section of the time box.<br><br>

### **Name 5 commands you used, and what they do.**
<br>

1. cd - change directory, move up or down through directories (folders)
2. mkdir - make directory
3. rmdir - remove directory
4. pwd - print working directory, shows the directory we are currently working in
5. ls - list, shows a list of the files and folders in this directory<br><br>


### **Did you learn anything unexpected?**
<br>

Learning how to use the command line from this root level definitely demystified it for me. In the past I had only interacted with the terminal using instructions from the internet to do more complex functions I didn’t understand. Seeing how it could be used in action in a simple way makes me feel much more confident about using the command line interface going forward.

# Version Control with Git 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### **What's the difference between git and GitHub?**
<br>

Git is a version control software that is used to keep track of different versions of a project and its files. If we want to, we can use this locally on our own computer to keep track of our edits, or with others on our local network, without connecting to the internet.

Github is a file hosting service that is used to store our files and projects, and their changes, online. We can invite others to collaborate and contribute their own edits and versions over the internet, keeping record of everyone’s contributions and tracking all the ways that the files are changed.
<br><br>


### **Can you think of an analogy to describe them?**
<br>

Git is like all of the clothes in your closet. You can formulate and create different combinations of shoes shirts and accessories before committing to the outfit of the day, but you still have all the other options stored safely in your closet when you go out, if you want to change or change back later.

Github is like a friend’s house, where you and all your friends bring your clothes and your accessories, to contribute and work together on building each others outfits, with the ability to mix and match and combine items from each others wardrobes.
<br><br>

### **Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?**
<br>

Yes, I feel like I explored these ideas thoroughly and am not at risk of misunderstanding this distinction in the future.
<br><br>


### **Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?**
<br>

Yes, this time I set individual timers on my phone for each task which was helpful.
<br><br>

# Install and Explore Git

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### **What is a Git workflow?**
<br>

Git workflow is a way to interact with git that follows specific structure and rules to maximise efficiency by keeping use consistent. Git workflow can be utilised in lots of different ways, but the most important thing is that everyone on the team is following the same principals so that they can easily share and understand each others work. A good workflow should make it easy to understand all contributions, identify problems, undo mistakes, and be compatible with the cultural dynamic of the team.
<br><br>


### **What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?**
<br>

The structure and format of the Udacity course was well paced and easy to follow. I appreciate having audio explanations as I find these easier to process than written information. When I got lost or confused, I went back over the lesson to see if I had missed anything, and turned to Google if I was still stuck. I was able to easily find answers to my questions by searching online, and didn’t feel stuck on any one problem for longer than five minutes.
<br><br>


### **Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?**
<br>

About half-way through, after finding myself constantly clicking between different windows and programs while completing the lessons, I looked up keyboard short cuts to make my interface more streamlined and efficient. I think this will be useful in my learning going forward.
<br><br>

# Track and Commit

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### **How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?**
<br>

Committing something in Git is submitting a piece of code that you have edited or altered within a wider program. Each commit contains a message explaining what this code does, so that we can keep track of all the different changes that are happening in a program. We commit each change or addition separately so that if the code has problems or needs to the modified again, we can refer specifically to that change without risk of altering the wider program. This also means we can keep a working version of program available while we make additions and adjustments. Before making a commit, we move each file that we want to include in our commit into the “staging” area. This is a way to make sure that all the files relevant to the specific change we are working on will be included together in the same commit. We only commit the change once all the correct files have been added to the staging area.

# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### **What is main?**
<br>

Main is the primary, working version of our program. This is where all approved edits and modifications made on branches will eventually get merged to.
<br><br>


### **Why create a Branch?**
<br>

Branches are used as a place to experiment, and try out additions and changes, without risk of effecting the main. This is particularly useful when you have multiple people working on the same program. Once the branch is working and reviewed, it can then be safely merged into the main part of the program.
<br><br>


### **Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?**  
<br>

Working on different branches before merging into the code feels intuitive to me. The thing I would like to understand more in depth is how this will work if multiple people have been making changes to the same part of the code, and how conflicts with incompatible code are addressed and resolved.
<br><br>


# **GitHub Fork & Clone**

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### **What are some examples of when you would fork?**
<br>

Creating a fork can be useful in an open source project where people who may not have permission to edit the main program can try out their ideas and improvements before submitting a pull request to the project owner.

It can also be useful when using someone else’s program as a starting point from which you develop a separate, new project of your own.
<br><br>


### **Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?**
<br>

Most of my technical learning so far has been quite linear and straightforward, I think largely due to the thorough and well-paced lessons and learning materials.

The biggest “click” moment I have had, is when we talked in our first home group about the importance of engaging with each other through this process and sharing in our experiences and struggles. I think I had assumed that my interpersonal skills were already developed enough that this wouldn’t be an issue, but I am now recognising that I am often inclined to isolate myself. My big "click" is realising that I need to challenge myself to develop a more open, communicative and collaborate learning style.

# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### **Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?**
<br>

This activity was pretty straight-forward.

If I’m honest, the only time I have felt a little frustrated doing this work was when I realised that we would be making a blog and that our reflections were going to be shared and evaluated. I enjoyed writing reflections while doing the course prep, but I didn’t realise that this side of things would be so significant in this course.

Working in the music industry and being in the public eye, I was under constant pressure to share my inner world, my feelings and my experiences, often in environments where it wasn’t really safe to. Over the years, it eroded my self-confidence and warped my self-image. I find it harder now to feel safe when I am being vulnerable, and am hyper-vigilant of the way I think I am being perceived by others.

I believe managing these feelings will be one of my big challenges in this course.
<br><br>


### **If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made, was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?**
<br>

 It does make it feel less intimidating breaking it down to this primary level. It’s giving 2009 Tumblr customisation.
 <br><br>





# Thinking like a programmer

### **What is your process so far for solving problems?**
<br>

I am always excited by the prospect of problem solving in coding. In completing the tech section of sprint 1, when I was met with an error or task I wasn’t sure how to approach, I would read again over the lesson then look outward for more resources online to help me understand. I am particularly drawn to YouTube explanations because I find audio processing is my strongest way of absorbing new information.

I find it hard to reach out and connect with others over the internet, especially strangers, so when I was faced with the more abstract task of coming up with analogies, I challenged myself to reach out to my cohort on discord for advice.
<br><br>





# Introduce yourself

### **What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?** 
<br>

This was challenging for me in a way that I wasn’t really prepared for. The idea of communicating your identity is something I had to do often in my music and on social media in my last career. But it sometimes meant taking authentic parts of yourself and manipulating them to fit a story that someone else thinks is important. I’ve become cautious to share myself out of fear of being misunderstood or rejected.
<br><br>

### **Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?** 
<br>

Totally self conscious. And like, desperate to control the way I am perceived.
