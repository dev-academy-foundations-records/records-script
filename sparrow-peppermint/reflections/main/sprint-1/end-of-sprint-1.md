# Final Reflections - Sprint One 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?

I feel as though I managed my time well, as well as my environment. I constructed and decorated a dedicated workspace in my bedroom where I would want to work each day, which helped to minimise distractions and get into the right headspace. I took my time reading each piece of information thoroughly and made sure I understood concepts completely before moving on. I used the time box recommendations, primarily when it came to exploring concepts online and other less structured tasks, and utilised the pomodoro timer during longer tasks to help with my focus.

My biggest problem was managing my emotional reaction to the blog concept. I found myself fixating a bit on worrying about how I will be communicating and how I will be perceived and this was distracting.


### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I have reviewed each of the Learning Competencies and I feel confident about all of them.


### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?

Learning to use the command line and then utilising it for all different tasks through sprint 1 Tech.
Learning about version control and how it is useful. Got me thinking about how version control software could be utilised in other areas, such as music production and arrangement.


### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

Markdown formatting.
Spending too much energy dwelling on and over-analysing how I was being perceived by others.


### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

I could feel my inner saboteur trying to be competitive with where others were at during the sprint, as well as making me doubt my ability to overcome my self-consciousness. I appreciate the learning we did on neuroplasticity and the growth mindset, as this helped me to interrupt these thoughts and turn them from self criticisms into a curious desire to grow in these areas.
