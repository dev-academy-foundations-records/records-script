# Final Reflections - Sprint Four 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?

I feel confident with each of the learning competencies in this sprint.

### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel smart?

Superfizzbuzz. I was able to write these functions easily and intuitively. 


### Which parts of this sprint made you feel un-smart?

Javascript katas grade book, adding the scores to their corresponding students in the grade book object. I couldn’t figure this out for ages until I looked at threads on discord.

### How did you look after yourself this sprint (stretching, breaks, rewards, etc)?

I’m learning that it’s worth taking those 5 minute breaks, even when I feel like I’m on a roll, or if I feel I haven’t been focused enough. They help me work better and for longer. I have also found connecting with a friend I’ve made in my cohort really helpful. It’s empowering and affirming when you are able to share an intense experience with someone.


### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this sprint, what would it say? 

I’m proud of you for trying so hard and caring so much, don’t forget to enjoy the journey.
