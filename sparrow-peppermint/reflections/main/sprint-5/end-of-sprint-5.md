# Final Reflections - Sprint Five 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:


### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really good?

The sort of community mentality of working on the same exercises together. It’s been a long time since I made new friends, and most of my work over the last few years has been very isolated. 

### Which parts of Foundations made you feel really bad?

When we first had to use our html and css learning to make our blog! I found this step quite overwhelming, but I’m proud of myself for pushing through.

### Was Foundations what you expected it to be like? If not, what was different?

I expected it to be more self-directed. I was surprised how much communication and connection there was with the other students and facilitators. I was also surprised by the depth of the core curriculum.


### How many times during Foundations did you want to give up? What kept you going?


 I got a little discouraged by the blog stuff. But I want to be challenged. Even when it was hard I was grateful to have concrete work to focus on, and such supportive guidance from the discord.

### You're going to be starting bootcamp soon. Do you feel ready? Prepared? Under prepared? How does that make you feel?

 I feel a little underprepared. There were definitely some moments this week where I got a little confused and overwhelmed. But I am going to take the rest of this week to review some of the gaps in my knowledge and try to build my confidence going into boot camp.

I’m also suddenly aware that I’m going to be around other people 5-6 days a week... what am I going to wear? Haha




### If you received a time traveling text message from your _future_ self, 10 weeks from now, what would it say?

I’m proud of you, you got this. (also we're now 6 months on T and our moustache is coming in real nice!)


### Do you feel like a programmer? If yes; why? If no; why not?


The moment I made my first basic program that worked I’m like, yes I am a programmer. 
Nouns are weird.
