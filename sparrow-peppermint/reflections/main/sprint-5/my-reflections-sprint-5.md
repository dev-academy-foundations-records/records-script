# My Reflections - Sprint Five 


# Tic-Tac-Toe

### What was the most challenging part of this exercise for you?

It was kind of daunting looking at the empty js file and reading over / thinking of all the steps involved in making such a simple game! So there’s a challenge to pushing through that feeling and taking it on one small step at a time.

### What learning(s) are you going to takeaway from this exercise?
Knowing that I was able to make the program work, after how intimidated I was at the beginning was a real confidence boost. I like the idea of building confidence in one’s abilities through action. Like proving to yourself that you can do it in small ways, and then having more trust in yourself the next time you come across a similar challenge.


# Pair Programming

### Do you have any prior experience pair coding? If so, what was the experience like for you? If not, what is your initial reaction to pair programming?

This was my first time pair programming! I was excited to do it, but it was a bit of a challenge to go from scribbling ideas from your head straight into code, to communicating them to another person.



### Do you personally think working and pairing with others will be a challenge for you during Bootcamp? Why so?


It is a challenge that I appreciate. I think it definitely depends on the person, but getting to see how others think and solve problems always helps me understand and learn faster.

For years as a songwriter I only wrote alone because the process of sharing and communicating felt so daunting. But once I did start collaborating on songs with others I saw how quickly my creativity and skill set grew.

Everyone brings something different to the table and if you’re only working from what’s in your own head you will be limited by that.

# Inflate the Unicorn

### Did you learn anything new during this exercise? What was it?

Using this.id in the html to pass the id of a specific element through a function eg onclick = “inflate(this.id)”


### Did you encounter issues completing any of the steps of this exercise? How did you resolve this?

Yes this one actually took me ages haha. I tried a bunch of different approaches that got progressively more complicated until I broke the problem down and went to google for help. 



### If you were to replace the unicorn with another mystical animal of your choice, what would it be?

 Santa’s reindeer


# Whack-a-mole

### What was the hardest part of this exercise?

I found this exercise easier after all my experimenting and learning on inflate the unicorn! I didn’t really get stuck at any step, just worked through adding each element gradually.



### Can you think of any different ways you could have accomplished the same outcome?


After I watched Josephs workshop, I have learned about the .appendChild() method which could also be used to move the mole around the table.

# Dress the Clown

### How did you find the process of refactoring your code?




### Would you do anything differently if you were to start this challenge again?




### What piece of code are you proudest of from this exercise?




# JS Carnival

### What parts of these challenges did you enjoy? If we were to add more challenges, what would you like to have more of?


I really enjoyed all of these challenges! I think each of them expanded the right amount on the ideas we are learning. At first I felt as though there could be a little more guidance in terms of learning the methods and techniques that are available, but I also appreciate that part of the purpose of these exercises is to develop our research and problem-solving skills which are just as important.

### What parts weren't so good? Were there any parts that you felt stuck on?

 The hardest parts for me to get my head around was the interaction between the js, html and css files. It requires you to think in and understand each language and at times I found it difficult to internally construct and map out their interactions.


### Which parts made you feel confident?


 Every time I tried something and the program worked the way that I intended. At the end of each exercise, playing around with the working product was so affirming and satisfying.

### What personally would you want changed to improve the carnival?

I think there could be a little more guidance on some of the techniques. Like a prerecorded version of what Joseph and Gerard do in their tutorials, in the handbook.
