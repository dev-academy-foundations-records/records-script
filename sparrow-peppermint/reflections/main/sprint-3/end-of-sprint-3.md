# Final Reflections - Sprint Three 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

 ### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies? 

Emotional Intelligence Exploration - 10/10<br>
Intro to Javascript - 9/10, I feel confident about these to the extent that we learned them in this sprint, but obviously we are only scratching the surface here so still plenty more to go to continue expanding our learning.<br>
The Dom - 10/10<br>
Manipulating the DOM - 9/10, as above, feeling good but still plenty more to learn about JavaScript events and using them to manipulate the DOM<br>
JS Fundamentals - 10/10
 
 
 ### Which parts of the this sprint made you feel happy? 
Last sprint I felt I had to push myself pretty hard to keep up, which left me a little frazzled at times. But jumping into Intro to JavaScript helped me to regain some confidence and excitement about learning. These exercises made me feel good about my ability to problem solve, and reminded me how much fun I have doing coding problems.
 
 ### Which parts of this sprint made you angry? 
 Some of the learning around EQ and mindfulness was tricky for me. It’s hard not to come at these things with some baggage or judgement. I tried to push myself to approach these things with curiosity and check myself when I noticed my judgmental voice creeping in.


 
 ### How many times during this sprint did you want to give up? Why didn't you? 

I do find portions of the core learning quite confronting and sometimes have to take it in in small doses to keep perspective. I think I am still adjusting my expectations to include this emotional introspection that I wasn’t really prepared for. But each sprint I find a deeper acceptance of why this is important, not just for my employability but for my personal growth in life, and I am grateful for the challenge.
