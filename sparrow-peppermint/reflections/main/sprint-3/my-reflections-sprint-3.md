# Mindfulness  
 ### Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them? 
 
The concept of mindfulness has been floating around the ethos for a while. I’ve touched on it a few times in therapy and well-being resources / apps over the years. 

I think for me it kind of falls into the category of things I know would probably make me fitter / happier / more productive (radiohead), but that I’ve never had the discipline to commit to. Like physical exercise, better sleep habits, morning routines, stop drinking sugar free red bull every day etc etc. 


 ### How did you find the overall experience?  

I tried my best to put down the baggage and come at these exercises with an open mind. I did catch myself thinking about these reflections a few times when trying to meditate, like I was really in the midst of doing it and already writing some kind of review in my head. 

But I could feel the peace that came over me at times, and appreciate that over time my well-being could benefit from making this practice part of my routine.
 
 ### What's your daily habit commitment for mindfulness?    
 
My commitment now is to stay open minded and try a different guided meditation each morning to find if there’s a specific method that I feel is best suited for me and that I am most likely to stick with.
 
 
 # Listening and Looping  
 ### What was it like to be fully listened to?  

A little intimidating at first, to speak alone without the back and forth interaction. But my partner for this exercise listened well, and reflected it back to me with perception, encouragement and accuracy

 
 
 ### What was it like to fully listen? 
   
A little challenging not to react, or add any questions that diverted the conversation away from specifically what had been said. But committing to listening helped to get a more focused snap shot of my partner’s point of view without trying to filter it through my personal lens




# Intro to JavaScript

 ### What did you notice about your learning style? What worked for you, and why? 

I was really excited to see JavaScript was an object oriented language. The only language I was familiar with before starting this course is Python, and I think this structure is more compatible with how my brain works naturally. I enjoy logic problems and I am always interested in making things as efficient as possible. When working in html/css last week I often found myself getting distracted thinking of functions I could write to make the code simpler to interact with. I really enjoyed the puzzles and exercises in the Intro to Javascript chapter.

 
 ### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions? If not, was it due to difficulty understanding the basics, or a feeling like you had to  _master_  the basics? 


I moved through the Intro to JavaScript repo fairly quickly compared to the time box suggestions, which allowed me to spend more time learning about the syntax of the language, and researching for and writing my blog entries.

 
 # JavaScript Cafe Lecture & Code-along 

 ### How did you find coding along to the JavaScript Cafe lecture? Did this help you see how combining JavaScript and the DOM interact together? 

I love being able to see the interactions, especially with events triggered by user input like the click. After the intro to javascript chapters, it was cool to see these things translate into something visual, and be able to follow the communication syntax.
 
 ### What was something you learned or realised from doing this activity? 
 
Nesting objects within other objects, and how to call a specific key or value. The randInt function seemed so complicated for what it does, so I looked into this a bit to see if there was a more efficient way which led to a kind-of-yes kind-of-no answer haha.
