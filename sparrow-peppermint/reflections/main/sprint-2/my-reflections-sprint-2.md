# My Reflections - Sprint Two

# Your Blog 

### **Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?** 
<br>

Using the command line, I navigated into the GitHub pages repository I am using for my blog site, and created a folder called “blog” where I will be keeping the content my blog entries.

I created an empty html file within this folder called te-houtaewa-template.html.
I copied the content from the student handbook into this file in Visual Studio Code, then saved the html.

I added this new “blog” folder and its contents to the staging area, then commit my changes with the message “Add blog”, as a way to log this specific step.

I then pushed my changes to GitHub so that this change would be stored online, making this te-houtaewa-template.html page viewable publicly from https://sparrow-peppermint.github.io/blog/te-houtaewa-template.html.

Next, within the GitHub pages repository I am using for my blog site, I created a folder called “styles” where I be keeping the css files, which store styling and formatting rules, for my blog.

Within this folder I created my first css file called main.css.

I then edited my template html file to link to this css file, which it will reference to inform how its content is styled and displayed.

I explored how you can use a browser to view html and css files stored on your computer locally, without connecting them to the internet.

I then added this new “styles” folder to the staging area, committed it to log this change, and pushed it to GitHub so it would be stored online.

### **How are you finding working with the timeboxes?**
<br>
I find it useful, though I am still adjusting to building this habit. Sometimes when I am eager to start or continue working I realise I haven’t been tracking for a few minutes and have to go back into toggl and remember to log before I continue.

# Learn HTML and CSS 

### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?
<br>
<u>Obstacle:</u> Indentation format in FreeCodeCamp interface makes it difficult to see nesting of elements and attributes clearly.
<br><br>
<u>How I overcame it:</u> Lots of patience. In some ways it made me have to examine each line more thoroughly to understand how the components were interacting.
<br><br>
<u>Obstacle:</u> Some dense language, not explained in plain language or as thoroughly as an instructor on a video would.
<br><br>
<u>How I overcame it:</u> Using text-to-speech software to help me comprehend information. Taking time to read each word carefully and outsourcing to google when there was something I didn’t understand. Supplementing understanding with video learning including the tech workshop video and udacity courses.
<br><br>


### What are of you proud of from this challenge?
<br>
I’m proud that I treated myself with patience and grace, and looked at opportunities to grow my learning with curiosity instead of frustration. I’m proud of recognising my needs and setting up the text-to-speech software to assist my learning.

 # DevTools Tutorial 
 ### What did you notice about your learning style, strengths, and limitations when doing this crash course? 
 <br>

I definitely felt a steeper learning curve here, and was a little confronted by the self-guided approach. I’m quite methodical and find it hard to move on from something unless I feel like I understand it completely.

I appreciated the audio-visual component, but the crash course was more fast paced than the previous work and I found myself pausing and going back a lot as I tried to follow along. 
 <br><br>

 ### Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them? 
 <br>

There was a lot of unfamiliar concepts and jargon and I kept wondering if I should go outside to research before moving on, or if I should just let some of it go over my head and move onto the next section. I got torn between not wanting to get behind but also not wanting to brush over things if they are important.

Ultimately asking myself these questions and trying to find a balance was helpful going forward, because it helped me examine my learning style and start understanding the best approach for my self-directed learning.

 ### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
 <br>
 
I have 11 tabs open! But they are all study related. I created a new user account on my computer specifically for dev work to help me stay organised and avoid distraction. It doesn’t have any of my logins for any personal accounts or entertainment.
<br><br>
 
 ### Did you do something funny with the Dev Tools, like insert your own name into the DOM of a website? If not, try it out.
 <br> 

I negotiated my dream vacation package from Walt Disney World down to a very affordable price

 # Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge 
 ### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  
 <br>
 

They’re like a very symbiotic couple. They’ve been together for many years and know and understand everything about each other. Like true soul mates, they appreciate each others skills and use their different passions and abilities to work together.

HTML is the practical, down to earth one. They manage the finances, organise the schedules, make sure there’s always an extra bottle of oat milk in the fridge.

CSS is the dreamy creative one. They make their home warm with decorations and colours and music, they bring light and laughter and love wherever they go. And they make sure that their partner doesn’t get too stuck in between rigid lines.

They are a wonderful team. 
<br><br>


 ### Any moments of surprise or joy? 
 <br> 
 
Honestly, at the beginning I found this process very frustrating. I struggle with visual concepts, and the open-ended creativity of like... do whatever you want. Especially because it’s a personal site about us! I deleted all my social media about six months ago to avoid being perceived. 

But I challenged myself to let go of my self-consciousness and do my best to be content with where I’m at on this journey. It brought me back to the neuroplasticity concept. I have ascribed traits to myself, like self conscious or obsessive, but I’m starting to learn that these things aren’t objective truth, nor are they fixed.

In challenging myself to do something I know I’m not confident in or experienced with, I found some freedom. Like proving to myself that I have more agency and power than I believe.
<br><br>



 ### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?
 <br>

HTML would be a beaver, organised and methodical. They think ahead when building their dams and use all different components to make them as strong and effective as possible. And they work.

CSS would be a rock sparrow, a decorator and collector of beautiful things. They seek out feathers from other, more colourful birds, and bring them back to decorate their nests. Where other birds build their nests simply to be practical, the rock sparrow finds joy and pride in making their nests beautiful too.
