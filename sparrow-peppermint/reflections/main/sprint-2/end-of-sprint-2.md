# Final Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:

### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?
<br>

HTML & CSS Blog Setup 10/10<br><br>
Learn HTML & CSS 8/10 - I think I need to learn more to understand the media queries, responsive design portion.<br><br>
DevTool Tutorial 7/10 - I found this one a little hard to follow as I outlined in the sprint 2 reflections. Looking at the learning competencies listed, I feel like I understand each of them, but maybe need to do a little more work to feel confident in them.<br><br>
Add HTML & CSS to your Blog 8/10 - I feel good about all except again the media queries needs a little extra attention before I feel fully <em>confident</em>.<br><br>
Technical Blog 9/10 - Feeling good, most confident in the topic I wrote about, would probably benefit from looking specifically into each of the other topics as well<br><br>
JavaScript Primer 10/10 - I feel really excited to learn more javascript. Based on the primer, it uses a structure and format that feels more intuitive to me.
<br><br>



### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?
<br>

The freecodecamp and audacity courses, learning specific html and css functions. 
Describing my strengths and limitations.
<br><br>

### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?
<br>
Formatting my blog. I know that the aesthetic isn’t important in this context, but I definitely got a little fixated on trying to make things sit in the space the way that I wanted.
I would look up functions that seemed simple (like creating a grid structure), and found implementing them like, unnecessarily complicated.<br>
I also felt anxious about sharing my blog with the group, especially the Identity and Values part.
<br><br>

### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?
<br>

I honestly feel much more aware of my self critical voice since doing these reflections. I find myself engaging with it less and dismissing it more when I’m trying to learn or get work done.<br>

I’m also realising how much my perception of myself has been informed by a fixed mindset and negative self talk. I’m excited to continue growing and see how much more I can achieve when I’m genuinely treat myself with generosity and grace.
<br><br>


### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?
<br>


It depends how technical you want to be. If you want a user friendly, low input experience, there are a lot of sites that allow you to make a website using templates and drag and drop tools.

If you want to understand how to do it from scratch, the main steps you would want to take are
- Chose a domain or place to host your site. You can do this by securing a personal domain name, or by using a host server such as GitPages
- Use html to write the content of your page,
- link your html to a css file which dictates the style and formatting of your page
- Connect your html and css files to your host server
- Obviously you would have to know some html and css to do this so go learn some!
